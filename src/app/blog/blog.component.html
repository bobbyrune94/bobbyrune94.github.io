                    <p>Wow time has flown by. One second, I’m a college fourth year that just had my hopes and dreams dashed after COVID hit, the next second I’m in a new house opening Pokémon Cards and streaming games to friends I’d never met in-person before. The only way I can describe the past year is with the following saying: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. I took my first steps in 2021.</p>
                    <h2>New Roles on Twitch</h2>
                    <p>Twitch has become my new college campus. 1.5 years ago, in 2020 (jeez that was only a year ago?!?!), I had my college life ripped away from me and was shoved into my parents’ basement to be lonely and depressed. Joining Twitch in October of 2020 let me interact with other people who share my interests and hobbies. This year, I came out of my shell and became far more active on the platform as a moderator and even as a streamer.</p>
                    <h4>Twitch Modding</h4>
                    <p>At the start of the year, I was still hunting for Dynamax Adventure shinies with <a href="https://twitch.tv/TerribleTavi">TerribleTavi</a> and his community. I had become fairly active in his chat, hosting parallel raids so other people could hunt while watching our favorite streamer. When Tavi opened applications to be moderators in his chat, I figured: why not? I was invested in his streams and wanted to give back to the first streamer I ever talked who had welcomed me in and fostered an amazing and supportive community. To my surprise, he had noticed my effort hosting raids and added me to the mod squad, even though I had only been around for a couple months. </p>
                    <p>My programming background helped me learn the ropes pretty quickly. StreamElements doesn’t have great documentation on how much we can do with chat commands, but luckily all a mod really needs to do is make a couple instructional commands, clip shiny reactions or anything dumb that Tavi says, and occasionally call him out on his smooth brain moments. I also added a couple commands once I figured out how to add and subtract custom values to counters so that mods don’t need to spam “!sb” a million times when Tavi does something REALLY dumb.</p>
                    <p>Months later, after I had started streaming, I was hanging out with DrSavvy, a new friend I made this year, and she needed some help in her streams. Seeing that there were no mods around, she decided to make me a moderator for her so I could help out. Poor girl had no clue what she just unleashed. I’m not as consistent in her chats as I am with Tavi’s, but I do enjoy causing chaos whenever I join. Savvy has also supported me on my own streaming journey, so we’ve become fast friends, though I will never make the mistake of modding her in my chat. I know she’s itching for revenge.</p>
                    <p>Becoming a mod has helped pull me out of my shell and be unapologetically myself to strangers I’ve never met. Maybe it’s that green sword icon next to my name boosting my ego, but I’ve let go of a lot of old anxieties about chatting on Twitch. I can joke around, tease the streamer, tease other chatters, make silly commands with goofy clips, cause riots (i.e. chanting dance emotes when Tavi leaves), or whatever else I feel like doing. I’ve also let go of my anxieties in other people’s streams as well, and that has helped me make some new streamer friends in the past year including, but not limited to:</p>

                    <p>Post-Christmas Addendum: Tavi sent us (his mods) each a bag of Trolli sour gummy worms and a transparent, light-up Pokéball with our Pokémon of choice inside (naturally, he shipped me an Eevee). HUGE thank you to Tavi for the christmas gift. I started modding because I wanted to give back to you and the community you've created, so it's humbling to think that you'd want to go out of your way to want to give back to us. But, you've made a grave miscalculation. Giving us sour gummy worms will only give us more energy to booli you in the coming year ;).</p>
                    <h4>Twitch Streaming</h4>
                    <p>One thought I had at the end of last year was to start streaming. These feelings only amplified after watching Tavi grow throughout the first half of the year. Having a community that would love, support, and hang out with me is exactly what I need in this time of isolation. After building a new PC in August and changing my Twitch name from bobbyrune94 to KungFu_Kenny98, I started my first Twitch stream on August 21st. Originally, it was supposed to be a test stream as I figured nobody would join, but some friends saw I was streaming through my Discord status and crashed my first stream. Imagine the shock on my face when I was clicking through OBS, testing features and assuming I had 0 viewers, then a message pops into my chat “Omg Bobby’s streaming?!?!” (they called me bobby from my old username). We ended up playing some Pokemon Unite before crashing Tavi’s stream later that night. It was great seeing him slowly realize this new streamer was actually his old mod in a new name.</p>

                        <div class="Blog-sectionText">
                            <p>Since then, I’ve streamed:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Let’s Go Eevee Nuzlocke (for 100 subs)</li>

                            <p>Some one-off games I’ve streamed (may or may not stream them again, depends on my mood)</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Halloween Phasmophobia</li>
                                <li>Apex Legends</li>
                                <li>Halo Infinite</li>
                                <li>Pokémon Unite</li>

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Through Tavi, SBCoop, and my new streamer friends’ support, I was able to reach Affiliate in only 2 weeks on September 7th, got some amazing emotes commissioned by <a href="https://twitter.com/dazzlingleams">@dazzlingleams</a>, and reached 200 followers by the end of the year (Dec 19th to be exact)! </p>
                    <p>My goals for streaming are two-fold. 1) to hang out with friends, meet other people online, and to share my excitement for games (the classic reasons to stream) and 2) to share my love for Wushu with my friends. The second reason was why I changed my name to KungFu_Kenny. After I reached Twitch Affiliate and got access to channel points, I added redemptions for Kungfu Kombo and Lightsaber Twirls so I can break my streams up with some physical activity and share my art with the world. </p>
                    <p>Some memorable moments from the past year:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Having mod experience from Tavi’s streams really helped me when I set up my own streams. I’ve been able to change my game mid-stream through commands, create a dadjoke command (calling an API), and custom counter interaction commands (which I added to tavi’s chats). I'm also constantly finding new ways to improve my own commands and I happily share these new techniques with the streamers I mod for.</p>
                    <p>I’m excited to see where I’ll go in the next year! Even now, in the grace period between vacation and streaming again, I’m excited to get into more pack openings, TGA graded cards, and all games that are coming out next year (see later section).</p>
                    <p>If you are reading this and would like to hang out, I'd greatly appreciate a follow at <a href="https://twitch.tv/KungFu_Kenny98">twitch.tv/Kungfu_Kenny98</a>. You'll be able to see when I go live and I'd love to see you come in and hang out with us sometime!</p>
                    <p>My streaming schedule so far has been: (times listed in Eastern US Time)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>9:30pm - 1am Monday Nights</li>
                        <li>9:30pm - 1am Wednesday Nights</li>
                        <li>10:30pm - 2:30am Fridays Nights</li>
                        <li>Maybe a weekend stream if I feel like it</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>New Townhouse</h4>
                    <p>One of the goals from last year was to move out with my college friends. We spent the first half of the year searching and visiting many places, but some of them weren’t as anxious to move out as I was. We eventually found and moved into a nice townhouse in early September. I’m sharing a bathroom with Conner, but got the mid-floor office for myself that I set up to be a streaming room. Bookshelves in the back are full of Legos, plushies, and whatever other random display pieces I have. My new standing desk is covered in streaming equipment and Lego-built displays for the graded cards I will be getting soon while my old desk, which I had pushed to the side, is covered in boxes of bulk cards that I still need to figure out what to do with. </p>
                    <p>The new townhouse also meant I needed some new exercise equipment. Inspired by the workouts I did while still at my parent’s house and what I practiced in weight-lifting class, I bought a dumbbell set (max 88 lbs) and a bench to keep my jump rope company. With Joseph’s own weight set and pull-up/dip cage, we had enough equipment to work out any muscle in our bodies. </p>
                    <p>Moving out also meant establishing new habits and schedules. My weekdays basically look the same: 9:30am-5:30pm work, 6-7:30pm workout/shower, 7:45-9pm dinner, 9pm-2am stream/mod/game with roomies. Weekends are normally free. I might go to my parents’ for dinner, buy groceries, play more games with the roommates, booli more streamer friends, or whatever else I feel like doing.</p>
                    <p>Living in the new townhouse with my old friends has brought back most of the college feel again. We’re playing Smash and Mario Party on the couch, asking for impromptu Apex or Valorant games, randomly going out for bubble tea or movies, and chatting about anything while making/eating food. We even watched one of the best shows of 2021, Arcane, over dinner. Even though I might have the most different hobbies of the four of us, I still feel somewhat complete again. It feels just like old times.</p>
                    <h4>New PC and Equipment</h4>
                    <p>While I had been thinking about streaming since last year, my laptop from college wasn’t up for the job. Whenever I would use StreamLabs OBS (I had no idea the difference between it and OBS Studio at the time), my computer would crash after a couple minutes as I’d be adjusting layouts or figuring out how my capture card worked. It also would struggle to run Apex Legends and Valorant when I would play with my roommates, so I knew I needed to upgrade at some point.</p>
                    <p>Originally, the plan was to upgrade after we moved. I figured it would be easier to assemble everything in our new house than to try to move everything there. However, by mid-summer, we were still only visiting places, the roommates were still iffy about committing, and I was getting impatient. Figuring I could at least start some research, I poked around Amazon and asked around for PC building tips from experienced friends. After a couple weeks, my impatience got the better of me. I used all of my Amazon Employee Discount to buy all the parts and built my new PC in August, complete with a new 30’ 1080p curved monitor. On top of PC parts, I also bought stream equipment as well, including a microphone, webcam, and, recently, a more expensive, but reliable, capture card. </p>
                    <p>Putting together and researching PC parts has given me a better appreciation and understanding of how computers work. I finally have an understanding of what certain specs mean when people talk about their PCs. I finally know how all the parts fit together. I finally know what it’s like to not work on a laptop. It’s odd to think that for all of my school life, I had been using only laptops. They were easier to travel with and I only needed to run RAM heavy software like programs, IDEs, and virtual machines. Now, with my newfound free time to play games and stream to friends, I need a bit more power on the graphical side that the new PC satisfies. </p>
                    <p>Not only has this new PC let me start streaming, it’s also let me dabble in new games I never could have played before. I could now play the newest Halo game on this new computer and enjoy the graphics on the new monitor without worrying about frame drops. Apex and Valorant also run noticeably better here than on the laptop. Now I can watch myself miss my shots in 4k.</p>
                    <h4>New Hobby</h4>
                    <div class="Blog-section">
                        <img class="Blog-sectionVerticalImage" src="assets/images/blogPics/tgasample.PNG" alt="TGA Graded Umbreon GX Sample">
                        <div class="Blog-sectionText">
                            <p>Watching content creators like aDrive and Tavi open cards brought me back to elementary school when I would beg my parents to buy me Pokémon cards. Now that I was making money, I figured I’d hop on the trend and see what the hype is about. What originally started as a birthday present has now expanded into a very expensive collecting hobby. I bought myself some Vivid Voltage booster boxes for my birthday in hopes of pulling some cool cards, specifically the Full Art Nessa (my favorite Sword/Shield waifu) and some eeveelutions. After not pulling what I wanted (surprise, it’s hard to pull the rares you want), I proceeded to buy more…and more…and more. I opened hundreds more packs of Vivid Voltage for the Full Art Nessa card, pulling every other Full-Art trainer card in the set except Nessa... (I eventually bought one off an ebay seller). When new sets came out, I bought booster boxes of those to see if I could pull something cool. I also dabbled in popular older sets like Hidden Fates in hopes of pulling a shiny eeveelution card (pulled the Shiny Espeon and bought the Shiny Umbreon). </p>
                            <p>Opening cards brings me the same rush as shiny hunting, though at a much more frequent rate. It’s exciting to pull a super rare card, such as a Full Art, Secret Rare, or Alternate Art, and display it on my desk to admire. Especially for the rare cards, the art is also spectacular to look at. Now that I’m streaming my card openings, I can share my joy with my community and capture my reactions so I can look back on them in the future. I don’t think I’m quitting this hobby anytime soon, though I don’t think my bank account appreciates that.</p>
                            <p>To preserve my rarest cards, I sent them off to The Grading Authority (TGA) to be graded, slabbed, and protected. TGA not only gives great prices for grading, it also allows us to choose the color of the slab to match the card we’re grading. For example, for a Shiny Umbreon card, I chose a blue label to accent the umbreon’s blue stripes (see attached picture). At the time, TGA was running a promotion for a chance to pack battle with aDrive, so I figured, why not? I’d get some of my favorite cards graded, including some holographic cards I still kept from years ago, AND have a chance to pack battle one of my favorite content creators! I didn’t get chosen for the pack battle, but I’m still excited to see my new slabbed cards and display them on my desk.</p>

                    <h2>Year In Review</h2>
                    <p>Here are all the games, shows, vacations, and other events that occurred throughout the year. </p>
                    <h4>Gaming</h4>
                    <p>While I was primarily focused on Pokémon for most of 2021, I branched off into some other games that had caught my eye. Here are the games that I enjoyed this year and some highlights.</p>
                    <b>Pokémon Sword</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Finished hunting all 47 Dynamax Adventure Legendaries. Took over 6000 raids and phased 164 times.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Longest Hunt: Giratina (499 Raids, amazing birthday present)</li>
                            <li>Fastest Hunt(s): Buzzwole, Zapdos, Yveltal (6 raids each)</li>
                            <li>I also started using Discord Voice Chats while doing DAs with the community to better coordinate strategies and I’ve met some of my new closest friends.</li>
                            <li>I also made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6PjD87ENvpwtxM2e_BUFVLQeo8NLQiCx26OMhoIXn8/edit?usp=sharing">Solo DA Guide</a> that compiled all my tips for raiding with an NPC team. It’s 14 pages long and I doubt anyone has read it, but it was still cool to write down my knowledge for others to read.</li>    
                        </ul>
                        <li>Also finished hunting all the other legendaries you could shiny hunt for in the Crown Tundra DLC, namely the Regis and Swords of Justice.</li>
                        <li>I stand by the fact that all the legends are affected by the shiny charm. My average hunt length over the 9 legends (3 Swords, 6 Regis) was 1,465 encounters, which is a little over the expected shiny charm odds of 1365. </li>
                        <li>Some other shiny hunts I did this year:</li>
                        <ul>

                    <h4>Shows</h4>
                    <p>I don’t watch many shows unless I really care about the franchise or a friend introduces me to it. I’d much rather play a game with a similarly great (or better) story and be actively engaging with it than mindlessly watching or being distracted with something else. Nonetheless, here were some of the great shows I watched this year:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Arcane</b>: Watched this with Stephen and Conner over dinner. I had never played League of Legends before, but the show was amazing! I immediately fell in love with the characters, despite starting on the second episode, and loved the story they told with all of them. And this isn’t even talking about the amazing music. I’m excited to see what season 2 brings for Vi, Jinx, Caitlyn, Jayce, Viktor, and the other characters. </li>
                        <li><b>Pokémon Evolutions</b>: This YouTube series released over a couple months, but the animation and stories it told for each region were beautiful. I loved how they dove deep into a character each episode and expanded into their inner thoughts for iconic moments in the games. I don’t normally get emotional, but some episodes almost brought me to tears. I hope to see more Pokémon animation like this. Check it out <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQWzKIaERirzFiThixbPIt7387B8GRKKI">here</a></li>
                        <li><b>Star Wars: The Bad Batch</b>: Watching the Bad Batch navigate the post-clone wars chaos, figuring out who they are, and finding their purpose in the dark times was interesting. I enjoyed Omega’s character more than the other first-season child characters from earlier animated series (i.e. Ahsoka, Ezra, Kaz). It was also great to see the conflict between the Bad Batch and Crosshair as well as learning that Crosshair willingly joined the Empire to find purpose. Excited to see what the next season brings next year.</li>
                        <li><b>Star Wars: Visions</b>: Star Wars meets Anime. Enough said. These stories were such a breath of fresh air from the regular Star Wars stories we were used to. We saw samurai jedi and sith, rabbit and droid jedi, family struggles, color-changing crystals, and so much more. My favorite episodes were: The Village Bride, The Ninth Jedi, and Lop and Ocho. Definitely would recommend for any Star Wars or Anime fan.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Vacations</h4>
                    <p>Despite COVID hanging over our heads, we went on two family vacations this year.</p>
                    <p>The first one in May was out to California to go see Yosemite and Lake Tahoe. Ever since my family started going to all the major national parks, I had always wanted to go see Yosemite. We finally did it this year.</p>

My sister came with us on this trip, a rare occurrence since she’s busy being a doctor. I had to work for a couple days in the middle of the vacation, but we saw a lot of dolphins so I’m a happy camper.</p>

                    <h4>The Accident</h4>
                    <p>I was heading home from my parent’s place along a narrow road with woods on either side late at night. I had gone to the office earlier that day, stopped by my parent’s house for dinner, and was heading back to the townhouse to stream with my community. </p>
                    <p>As I approached a downhill area, I noticed a car on the opposite side had stopped. Squinting at the car for a couple seconds, I wondered what was going on and hoped everything was fine. Things were not fine. Looking back at the road, a human body and a skateboard materialized just two feet in front of my car. There was nothing I could do. I had just run someone over. My mind immediately kicked into high gear. What did I need to do? Did witnesses call the police? We need to warn other incoming cars. Was the guy in the road responsive? Should we clear the debris out of the road? The police arrived soon and interrogated me about what had happened. How fast was I going? Was I impaired or distracted? What did I see before the accident? What did I do after I hit the guy?</p>
                    <p>In the down time between talking to the officers, I sat in my trunk and called my parents. I also let Twitter know that I wouldn’t be streaming that night. My mind finally had time to slow down, process, and feel emotion again. Fear. Sadness. Remorse. I should have done this differently. I should have noticed that. What would happen with insurance? Did I just kill someone? How did they end up like that? I cried for the first time in over a year.</p>
                    <p>Thankfully, my ex-girlfriend (we’re on good terms), after seeing my Twitter post, reached out to make sure I was ok. She kept me company for the hour or so it took for the crime-scene-investigators to arrive and interview me. It had been a while since we talked, so she redirected the conversation to other topics to catch up and keep my mind off what had happened. We talked about my streams, what life was like where she was, new and upcoming games and shows, whatever came to mind. She saved me that night. I would have gone insane and might have even hurt myself had she not been there. </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the guy didn’t survive. Police guessed he may have fallen from his electric skateboard into the lane I was traveling on and knocked unconscious, where I came by and hit him. The darkness combined with the downhill acceleration meant I didn’t have enough time to react. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time. The police and insurance didn’t fault me, but that didn’t stop me from blaming myself. Visions from that night where the body suddenly appeared in my headlights haunted me for days afterward. I couldn’t go into the office the next day as I didn’t trust myself to drive. Once I pushed myself to drive again, I would pass a small memorial in the day time whenever I traveled to my parent’s house, a consistent reminder of that fateful night that I won’t soon forget. </p>
                    <b>Other Events</b>
                    <p>Some other miscellaneous things happened this year to take note of</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Making a Twitter</b>: I resisted making a Twitter for years as I didn’t want to track multiple social media accounts that all did more-or-less the same thing. After I started streaming, I figured I’d make stream-start posts as well as interact with other people in the Pokémon Community, so I made a Twitter using my classic username <a href="https://twitter.com/bobbyrune94">@bobbyrune94</a>. A lot of content creators also host giveaways on Twitter, so I’ve been entering in those, liking, retweeting, tagging friends, not expecting anything to happen. Turns out, I won a VMax Climax booster box from my new friend SBCoop. Excited to open that in my first stream this year.</li>
                        <li><b>Rediscovered K/DA</b>: I randomly had a recommended YouTube video talking about the rise and future of the virtual band K/DA. No idea where that came from. I never played League of Legends, but I enjoyed their 2018 song Pop Stars and knew Ahri was attractive (I’m a simple man…), so I clicked on it. Through the video, I found out they released a set of songs in 2020. Those. Songs. Slap. After listening to just soundtracks for months, these lyrical, high-energy tracks got my blood pumping and head bopping. Like Kai’sa, their dancer, I couldn’t resist moving to the beat and mouthing the lyrics as I worked or exercised. Riot Games Music just earned another fan and I hope they bring K/DA back soon.</li>
                        <li><b>Buying the LEGO UCS Republic Gunship</b>: One of the best Lego sets released this year was the Lego Ultimate Collector Series (UCS) Republic Gunship. It’s one of a few prequel-era UCS sets that Lego created and it’s a massive beautiful beast. However, Lego released this set in the sloppiest, most disrespectful way. They put the Imperial Logo on the box instead of the Republic logo, called it an Original Trilogy instead of a Prequel-Era set, asked for and ignored fan-requested minifigures, and said fans couldn’t distinguish between a clone pilot and a yellow clone commander (spoiler alert: we can). Despite the controversy, I still wanted the set for myself. The model itself has so much detail that I’m willing to overlook the clearly disrespectful actions Lego made. My 200 Twitch Follower milestone was to build this on stream, so I’m excited to do so when I get back to streaming.</li>
                        <li><b>Seeing Co-Workers for the First Time</b>: Since COVID forced our jobs to all be virtual, I never had a chance to meet my coworkers in-person when I started working midway through 2020. This year, my team organized some activities so we could meet in-person and get to know each other. Two fun events were organized (Top Golf, Axe Throwing/Go Karting) as well as some in-office events where I got to work with the people on our team to test important milestones. It was nice to finally have a face to put to the Slack profile-pics and faceless Chime calls.</li>
                        <li><b>Reconnecting with an Ex</b>: At the start of our relationship, I thought that it would be easy to just be friends again if we ever broke up. Now that I’m experiencing it, I was…partially right. A lot of our interactions this year were through online texts, mostly her supporting me. She’s come into my streams occasionally to say hi and interact with my new friends. She checked in on me when I got into the accident. But the couple times we did interact in-person were, at least for me, awkward and stiff. I couldn’t help but reminisce about what used to be: how much we loved each other, how close we were, and how that would likely never happen again. It was a painful reminder of what I had lost almost two years ago, and all I could do was keep my distance while she chatted with our other friends. At this point, we’d grown so far apart that I couldn’t think of much to talk to her about. It almost feels like I have a crush on her again, that desire to be close to her while knowing that it would never happen. Seems like my scars haven’t quite fully healed yet.</li>
                        <li><b>Christmas Speeding Ticket</b>: I had never gotten into a car accident before this year. I had never gotten a speeding ticket before this year. We talked about my accident above. My Christmas gift almost was a reckless driving ticket. On our vacation in Charleston, I was driving in a somewhat residential area to a lighthouse, hoping to make it before sunset. Not noticing any explicit speed limits, I assumed it was around 35 mph, so I was hovering around 40mph. Oh boy was I wrong. I passed a police car and, of course, it turns its sirens on to pull me over. Turns out, the speed limit was 25 and I was going 14mph over! My mind started racing again. I was screwed. Years ago, I was in the car when a friend got pulled over for speeding and they made him go to court. My insurance costs would spike. I’d need to take a driving course. All this with my whole family in the car watching, waiting to disown me. Luckily, the officer had some Christmas spirit in him. He let me go with a warning and instructed my sister, who sat in the passenger seat, to keep me in check (i.e. punch me if I went too fast). On the way back from the lighthouse, we saw on Google Maps that the road alternated between 25 and 35 mph limits with no signs to tell us where the changes occurred. That was an obvious bullsh** speed trap, but I’m so happy I got out of a reckless driving ticket.  </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>2022: Hopes, Goals, Excitement</h2>
                    <p>With the couple steps I took in 2021, I’m excited to see where this journey takes me in 2022.</p>

                    <p>With all the friends I’ve made this past year on Twitch, I’ll continue supporting them and watching them grow next year. Obviously, I’ll continue modding for Tavi and Savvy, but I’d also be interested in getting to know new communities and contributing my knowledge to them. Kriskilinttv has requested for new mods that I threw my hat into. Right before I posted this, she brought me in to her mod squad for my technical knowledge. I don’t think she’s ready for what’s to come.</p>
                    <p>Big social events are also starting back up next year. PAX East was announced for April that a lot of my new creator friends are going to. Unfortunately, my parents scheduled a vacation during that time, but I would love to attend another event like TwitchCon or even a smaller, more personal get-together to meet my new online friends in-person. Like with my co-workers, it’s great to finally meet the people you only heard over voice calls or saw a couple times in video. My goal next year is to at least meet Tavi and the other people in the community I’ve grown close to. Tavi has a learn-to-backflip stream he still hasn’t done, so maybe I’ll use that as an excuse to meet him IRL. </p>
                    <p>For my own streaming content, I couldn’t be more excited. So many amazing new games are coming out this year (which I will talk about later) and I can’t wait to play them on stream with my friends. Like I stated earlier, I have TGA-graded cards waiting for me back in the townhouse as well as some more card orders coming in that I’m looking forward to opening. Have you seen the alternate-art Jolteon, Flareon, and Vaporeon coming in their respective premium collections? I pre-ordered them on vacation and I’m drooling just thinking about digging into them soon. </p>
                    <p>I also hope to expand the way I share my love of Wushu on stream. I had the idea for Wushu Weekends, where I’d find an open area in our neighborhood and stream me practicing Wushu and/or teach viewers some basic skills (weather permitting of course). However, my first attempt at it failed since, for some reason, my phone had issues streaming to twitch. I hope I can figure out how to get all that working because not only is it sharing my hobbies, it also forces me to keep practicing. Outside of that, I want to find more ways to incorporate Wushu into my streams outside of just a channel point redeem. Even with channel point redemptions, my viewers would much rather watch me twirl a lightsaber than perform kungfu kombos. Truth be told, I recycle the same basic movements over and over for lightsaber twirls, so it’s not as fun for me to do, not to mention how limited my space is. I have so much more variety and room to demonstrate barehand combinations, whether it’s different styles or movement planes, all without worrying (as much) about destroying something.</p>
                    <h4>Games</h4>
                    <p>2021 might have been a year of new beginnings, but 2022 will be the year of AMAZING GAMES!!! I have never been this excited about these games releasing next year:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</b>: I’ve been waiting for this game for OVER 2 YEARS. I had preordered the Deluxe Edition at Best Buy over a year ago, but the release date for this game kept getting pushed back. As of now, the date is set for Spring 2022 and I pray that it doesn’t get delayed any more. Lego Star Wars was my childhood, my introduction to Star Wars, and my favorite video game series. I can’t wait to play it again and share my love and excitement with my community.</li>
                        <li><b>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2</b>: I’ve been waiting for this game for over 2 years (déjà vu?). Breath of the Wild was one of the first games I played when I got my Switch and is still one of my favorite games. Through the base game and DLC, I grew to love the characters, the open world, the freedom, the combat system (except breaking weapons…), and the story. Nintendo teased us over 2 years ago at E3 2019, but recent Directs have shown more gameplay and it looks AMAZING. The Skyward Sword Remake was a nice hold-over, but I can’t wait to jump back into open-world (sky?) Hyrule</li>
                        <li><b>Pokémon: Legends Arceus</b>: Breath of the Wild meets Pokémon? My two favorite Nintendo franchises mixing? Um yes please! This game is releasing later this month and I’m so excited for this new take on the Pokémon formula. Even though I just went on a Sinnoh adventure in Shining Pearl, I can’t wait to see what new mechanics, story, and Pokémon this new game introduces. AND one of the recent trailers showed an Eevee running around, so I can have the bestest, most adorablest baby on my team (unlike a certain other Sinnoh game...)</li>
                        <li><b>Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes</b>: Not a new game, but I’m making so much progress in this game that I have to talk about my plans for next year. In 2021, I farmed all the requirements to unlock Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. I hope to finally unlock him within the first couple months of the year and finally have my first Galactic Legend. After that, I’m not super sure where to go. I really want to unlock Jedi Master Kenobi as my second GL, but I have no access to relic 8 materials at the moment, so unlocking him is impossible. Farming for Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (SLKR) is probably my best bet, but I’m not as passionate about his character as I am with Kenobi. We’ll see where I go when after I unlock Luke. I also need to grind up a lot of other teams as well so I might take the time to build out my foundation instead of going for another time-consuming GL. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Those are the big 3 that I’m looking forward to playing. Of course, over the year, I might try out other games that pique my interest, such as Kirby and the Forgotten Land (aka open world Kirby aka Breath of the Kirby), or tackle sequels to games I’ve already played (Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope). I also hear rumors of Halo Infinite getting campaign DLC. If those rumors are true, I’ll be playing more Halo Infinite in the near future, whenever it releases. </p>
                    <h4>Shows</h4>
                    <p>2022 isn’t just the year of amazing games, it’s also the year of Star Wars Shows. I haven’t seen this many shows release in a single year, and I’m excited to see what new stories and journeys each show takes us on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The Book of Boba Fett</b> (Technically started Late Dec, 2021, but might as well count it as a 2022 show): explores Boba Fett’s life trying to take over Jabba’s throne.</li>
                        <li><b>The Bad Batch Season 2</b>: explores the Batch after the destruction of Kamino. I have no idea what they’re going to do with that, but excited to see where the story goes.</li>
                        <li><b>The Mandalorian Season 3</b>: What’s going to happen now that Grogu is training with Luke? What about Din, Bo Katan, and the Darksaber? Are Boba and Fennec coming back? So many questions.</li>
                        <li><b>Ahsoka</b>: I’m cautiously optimistic about this. I’m not really a fan of live-action Ahsoka since she doesn’t move like in Clone Wars or Rebels, but I’m interested to see what stories they’ll be telling about her.</li>
                        <li><b>Obi Wan Kenobi</b>: Also cautiously optimistic. Not sure what stories they can tell when Obi Wan is supposed to just be a hermit on Tatooine, but definitely interested. </li>
                        <li><b>Andor</b>: No clue what to expect, but I loved Rogue One and would love to see the darker side of the early Rebel Alliance. Also I hope they bring K2SO in because that droid is hilarious.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Also, now that my roommates got me invested, Arcane season 2 is in development. Unfortunately, it won’t be releasing next year, but definitely still something I’m looking forward to watching in the future.</p>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Thank you to all the friends, new and old, who’ve supported me on these crazy new adventures this year. I feel like this year, I’ve picked up the fragments and pieces of my life that 2020 blew up and reassembled them into a different, but still complete, new life. </p>
                    <p>I can’t wait to see where I go in 2022. I can’t wait to make new friends, support my old friends, and experience all the new stories in the coming year. For the first time in a while, I have high hopes for the future again. Here’s to the future. Here’s to 2022.</p>

                    <p>It’s been over said at this point: 2020 was an awful year. A global pandemic, a heated US presidential election, natural disasters, imminent WW3, and a whole host of other things made the past 365 days the most emotionally-taxing anxiety-inducing year I’ve had the (dis)pleasure of living in. I came into the year with so much hope. I was in my final year of college. I was offered a job at one of the biggest tech companies in the world. I had a group of friends who had loved and supported me throughout my college career and was looking forward to have a big celebration of everything we’d achieved at the end of the year. And then 2020 happened. Everything was cancelled, I was basically forced back into high school again living with my parents, and a lot of pain, anger, and frustration followed suit.</p>
                    <p>Despite the myriad of stressful events, I want to acknowledge that there was still some light. My time alone helped me learn more about myself. I tried out new games and made great achievements in the ones I was playing. I forced myself outside my comfort zone to seek out other people who share my hobbies online. I think now is a great time for me to reflect on what happened in the previous year to 1) help myself remember what happened because I know my memory is god awful and 2) see where I can grow in the next year. I wanted to do this for 2020 since it was a memorable year (in all the wrong ways), but I might continue it for future years if I feel it’s worth it. We’ll see.</p>
                    <p>And now, I present: 2020, the Good, the Bad, and the Future</p>
                    <h2>2020: The Worst Year of My Life (so far)</h2>
                    <h4>COVID-19 Pandemic</h4>
                    <p>We’ve been talking about this for the past 9 months (wow it’s been a long time) and I’ve made two other posts below about my feelings toward it, so I’ll try to keep it short here. It sucks. Everything I was looking forward to got cancelled, we were all forced back home to be effectively high schoolers again, it became difficult to see friends, and a LOT of people are dead/dying while idiots run around thinking it’s fake. </p>
                    <p>I think it’s safe to say that, while our leaders are doing their best to keep everyone safe and away from each other and large gatherings, this pandemic has taken a serious toll on our mental health. I wanted to have regular interactions with friends with game nights and impromptu game sessions, but over time those stopped happening as people started classes again and stopped inviting me to play games with them (I understand, I’m bad and not really fun to play with), so I started feeling lonely. Nobody wanted to hang out with me since I spend most of my time playing mostly single-player experiences as that’s how I’ve grown up and what I’m comfortable with. I desperately wanted to feel the sense of community I felt when I was still in Charlottesville and surrounded by friends to hang out with on a whim. </p>
                    <p>Like I said in the intro, so much got cancelled because of COVID. My vacation to China over Spring Break and Greece/Italy over the summer? Cancelled. Birthday celebration with friends? Cancelled. My final Wushu competition? Cancelled. College graduation? Cancelled. Trying to get an apartment with friends? Cancelled (more like delayed, but same idea). It really hurts to know that we’re missing out on once-in-a-lifetime events like having a graduation ceremony. Sure we can have one next year (or possibly in 2022 if things don’t settle down), but it won’t be the same as the feeling of pride right after you worked so hard to achieve it. I know it’s my FOMO talking, and some of my friends have told me that I’m not missing out on much, but this is something that I’d really like to experience and know than to sit here and only imagine what it would be like.</p>
                    <h4>A Breakup</h4>
                    <p>Partially because of COVID separation, partially because of incompatible futures, my girlfriend broke up with me. It came at a time when I was the most desperate for any kind of social interaction from anyone, especially her, but wasn’t getting since everyone was too busy. She’d been back at school and was trying to balance schoolwork, running a club, and so many other responsibilities that she didn’t have much time to keep our relationship going. Furthermore, since she’d accepted a job in Seattle, trying to keep connected across the country in the future would be even more difficult. It was the right decision, but I was still devastated. She’d been my best friend for the past almost 2.5 years and someone I felt like I shared my life with. She was someone I relied on for the support and love that I needed in this time of crisis and gave me the only social interaction outside of my parents and co-workers.</p>
                    <p>And just like that, she was no longer there. I spent a lot of time writing down my thoughts and feelings as they came to cope with this, which has since grown into a 20-page Word document (why can’t I write like this for school…). While the logical side of me knows that this was the right choice and that trying to continue would be harmful for both of us, I still felt hurt and betrayed. She left me when I needed her the most and showed me, once again, how insignificant and unworthy I am. If the person who says they loved and cared for me and that I’m “important” to them isn’t willing to put in effort with me anymore, then who will? The short, instinctive answer: Nobody. The long answer: I’ll be writing about that in the “Good parts of 2020” section.</p>
                    <p>Even though I have a lot of feelings about what happened, we’re still friends. We share some common interests and whenever something new in those interest happens (hint: it involves the Mandalorian), we’ll shoot each other a message and have a short talk about it. But of course it isn’t the same; it’ll never be the same. All I can do now is cherish the memories we made together. If you’re reading this, I just want to say: what the hell are you doing? Don’t you have better things to do? But seriously, thank you for an amazing 1.5 years and I hope you’ve had a relaxing holiday break. You deserve it. </p>
                    <h4>Loneliness</h4>
                    <p>This isn’t new. I’ve been a loner since middle school after my parents started taking my academics more seriously and I couldn’t play much with friends anymore. I’ve spent most of my life studying or watching YouTube videos alone at my desk in my room. This completely changed in college when I found a friend group (Wushu club) that would hang out and play games together on a whim and I didn’t need to ask my parents for permission. I loved the freedom that I had and also finally saw how fun it is to have such a group of friends who enjoy your company. It made me feel like I was worth something when people would go out of their way to invite me over to watch a movie or play some games or out to get food and just chat. </p>
                    <p>And, of course, I got sent back to high school with COVID. At the beginning, it was fine. We had weekly game nights with the Wushu club, I would talk to my girlfriend every night, and I would occasionally play other games like Fall Guys and Valorant with other friends. But once the new semester started, everything changed. People stopped coming to game nights since they were busy with schoolwork, so we couldn’t play larger party games like Among Us. My girlfriend decreased our weekly call times before breaking up with me altogether (see above section) since schoolwork started piling up. My other friends moved on from the games we played or didn’t want to play with me likely because I was bad (I don’t blame them). And COVID surges made it riskier to get together and hang out in person. While I feel like my friends were getting together over discord and playing together on a regular basis, I was left high and dry in my room by myself. </p>
                    <p>Starting a new job didn’t help much either since the only interactions I had with my co-workers were of me asking them questions on how to do something. The weekly social hours were nice and I could enjoy a game of Pictionary or poker with them, but I miss the casual break-room or cross-desk chats that I had at my previous internships. </p>
                    <h4>Christmas Oncall Shift</h4>
                    <p>This was just unfortunate luck on my end. My job requires that all engineers be oncall to resolve issues our service may encounter. When my manager added all the summer new hires into the rotation, I ended up being the primary oncall for the week of Christmas. Oh boy.</p>
                    <p>Oncall seems to be a gamble for how bad it’s going to be. Sometimes, it’s quiet and we don’t have to worry about much. Other times, some large-scale event will make our service cut a lot of tickets at odd hours of the night and we’d have to get up and fix them. Mine was leaning toward the latter, though I may be looking at it with the holidays in mind and the general “I don’t want to work during holiday” mindset. </p>
                    <p>I first had a great Christmas present at 7:00 in the morning which, if you know me, I was quite unhappy about getting up that early. Then, the day after Christmas, I spent 4 hours in the afternoon and paged in multiple senior engineers and product managers only to realize that snowfall the previous night was blocking one of our sensors. Not to mention the general anxiety of going about my day not knowing if I would get paged in the next minute and need to run to my computer. That was a fun time.</p>
                    <h2>2020: A Year of New Beginnings</h2>
                    <p>While I’m sure to remember this year for all the bad events, I want to balance it out by talking about the good that’s happened this year (at least for me). </p>
                    <h4>Reconnecting with Graduated Friends</h4>
                    <p>One of the positives of moving back with my parents was that I was closer to my old housemates who had graduated in 2019. We started hanging out in September, after a lot of my Wushu club friends had started school again and were bogged down in classes and projects. It was really nice to have a semi-regular social event with friends again.</p>
                    <p>Bonding with them along with my fellow 2020 graduates became super important after my girlfriend broke up with me. They became the people I immediately turned to for support and I spent a lot of time in the week following the breakup talking through my feelings and playing games with them. They reminded me that even though I lost my closest friend, I was never alone and I’d have them behind me to bring me back up when I needed it. Who will spend time with me if the person who “loved” and “cared” for me the most won’t? The (not really) long answer is these guys. </p>
                    <p>Something likely irrelevant but still important to me is that when I was at one of their apartments the day after my breakup, I found a shiny Kricketot in Pokemon Go. Most people don’t give a flying heck about this, but as a shiny hunter, it spoke to me. I don’t know the probability of finding that specific shiny in PoGo is, but I feel it’s really small, just like in all the other games. Finding that one specifically when I was in a time of need and talking to my friends makes me believe that it was put there to remind me that I’m not alone, no matter how lonely and sad I feel at the time. To commemorate that, I named it “YourNotAlone” (I ran out of characters, ok, don’t attack me) and I look at it every now and then to remind myself that I have friends who care about me. </p>
                    <h4>My First Job</h4>
                    <p>It still blows my mind that Amazon offered me a job as a Software Development Engineer all the way back in November of 2019. I finally started working there in July 2020 in the middle of the pandemic, so I haven’t been able to go into the office and get to know my coworkers. All of our interactions occur over Slack for texting or Amazon Chime for video calls or meetings. I already talked about how impersonal and removed I feel from my team, so I’m going to focus on the positives here.</p>
                    <p>I’m learning so much about AWS. I came into the job not knowing much about it, but through having to develop for our service, I’ve picked up so much knowledge both about how our system works and how to use other AWS services to help debug issues. Further, while I complained about my Christmas oncall shift, I’ve learned even more from being oncall as I’m forced to also deal with issues from other aspects of our service that I don’t normally touch. </p>
                    <p>I can’t wait go into the office next year and actually interact with my coworkers face-to-face once everyone gets the COVID vaccine and we can all more or less return back to normal. </p>
                    <h4>New Passion for Pokémon and Shiny Hunting</h4>
                    <p>This has been my biggest time sink of 2020. Before, I enjoyed the Pokémon franchise, but I hadn’t had the chance to dive in very deep. Once the first DLC of Pokémon Sword/Shield came out, I started watching PokeTubers (Pokémon Youtubers) more to see what other people playing this game do. And that’s when I decided to try shiny hunting. For those that don’t know, shiny Pokémon are ones that (normally) have a different color scheme from their base form and super low chance to appear. A lot of times, the shiny Pokémon look much cooler than the regular form. Before, I though shiny hunting was just a long and boring thing and doesn’t give enough reward. Once I started though, I realized how enjoyable it is and how easy it is to multitask. I would watch my daily selection of YouTube videos and shiny hunt at the same time and, when I got the shiny I wanted, I’d get that rush of adrenaline and excitement that keeps me going. As a wise Twitch streamer once said, “Shiny hunting is just reading chat with a 1/1365 chance to yell really loudly.”</p>
                    <p>When the second DLC for Sword/Shield came out, it introduced all the previous legendary Pokémon in a new game mode: Dynamax Adventures. And when I heard I could shiny hunt for them, I knew what I wanted to do: I would get every shiny legendary I could. I enjoy this method much more since I actually have to think about where I want to go and trying to build a team to tackle the final legendary boss instead of mindlessly biking back and forth to hatch eggs or encounter in the wild. I like the strategy behind this game mode and learning how to use each Pokémon as well as manipulating the NPCs that join you to have the best odds of defeating the boss. While I often rage at the incompetence and stupidity of the NPCs they give me (when I run solo raids), I enjoy the challenge and get really excited when I finally get the shiny legend that I’ve been hunting for. There’s also a chance to get a shiny of any Pokémon I catch along the way, so it’s also a pleasant surprise if one of those shines. As of now, I’ve found 21 of the 47 available legendaries, so I’m on track to finishing around April-May of next year, assuming I can get version exclusives don’t get royally messed up by Zygarde or Groudon. </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, my IRL friends don’t have the same passion for hunting as I do (I don’t blame them) so I’ve taken to watching Twitch streamers do the same thing. It’s been really great to find people who share my passion and also who will host raids that I can join and hunt with them. I’ve become more involved in a smaller streamer’s chat and it’s slowly bringing back the feeling of community I’ve been craving. TerribleTavi, if you’re somehow reading this, thank you so much for fostering such a welcoming community. I look forward to your streams every night and always have a great time watching and raiding with you. You’ve helped me grow my passion for these games and inspired me to both exercise again and to potentially start streaming next year. </p>
                    <p>As I mentioned above when talking about my friends, I also got back into playing Pokémon Go for a little bit. Quarantine has made me antsy just sitting at home so when the weather was nice, I would go on walks and play Pokémon Go to keep myself entertained. Recently, I’ve lost that passion since it’s been cold and I don’t like walking out in the cold, but I still follow any new events and try to catch any newly released Pokémon. </p>
                    <p>I think playing these games has shown me how much I enjoy collecting things. It could be that I like to 100% complete objectives, or it could be my FOMO talking, like knowing that I have everything so I’m not missing out. Either way, I know this passion for these games won’t be ending soon and I intend to keep following Pokémon for the foreseeable future.</p>
                    <h4>Other Games I Love</h4>
                    <p>I’m grouping these together since I don’t have as much to say about them, but they were still highlights for me regardless.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="Blog-itemHeading">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity:</span> I enjoyed the original Hyrule Warriors game and also loved the lore of Breath of the Wild, so I was super excited when this game was announced and pre-ordered it. This was probably the most fun I’ve had playing a game since playing through the Pokémon DLCs the first time. I love the fast-paced combat system and how unique each characters’ fighting styles were, though we all know Impa is the best. After months of just shiny hunting, it got my adrenaline pumping again with all the epic combos and finisher moves I could pull off. Also the way it incorporated BoTW and the Warrior’s mechanics was really clever. The story was pretty fun to play through, though it was not what Nintendo advertised it to be. Spent around 80 hours to 100% complete the game; was very worth it.</li>
                        <li><span class="Blog-itemHeading">Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes:</span> This is the mobile game that I’ve been playing for the past 3 or so years that focuses around collecting and upgrading iconic (and sometimes not-so-iconic) Star Wars characters. It’s a classic free-to-play, pay-to-win game, but I enjoy it simply because it’s Star Wars. The first half of the year was really bad with some meta-breaking characters, some of F2P unfriendly decisions and a whole lot of nothing for new content, but recently the game has been adding in a lot of quality-of-life updates and making the overall game more F2P and beginner friendly. Also, I recently finally unlocked a character I’d been working toward for the past year, so that was a major achievement from me.</li>

                    <h4>Other Smaller, But Still Great Things</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="Blog-itemHeading">Wushu at Home with Brandon Sugiyama:</span> When I was forced home, I couldn’t practice Wushu anymore since there was no space to run and jump and swing around 7-foot spears. While I could practice outside, weather permitting, in the cul-de-sac, I didn’t have the motivation to as I missed the community I had as part of the UVA Wushu Club. In comes Brandon Sugiyama, a judge at one of our yearly competitions, hosting a twice-a-week Wushu class designed to be done in a confined area like an apartment or a room. Joining that class was so much fun as he taught us different styles and combinations and encouraged us to explore putting moves we practiced together and making our own sequences. I was sad to see it go as Brandon moved to a different country, but I look forward to it if he restarts it again.</li>
                        <li><span class="Blog-itemHeading">The Mandalorian: Season 2:</span> No spoilers, but that was an amazing season. Watching it gave me a lot of hope for the future of the Star Wars franchise (our lord and savior Dave Filoni). Not to mention the whole list of upcoming Star Wars shows that they announced at the investors meeting. I’m so excited for everything that’s coming.</li>
                        <li><span class="Blog-itemHeading">The Clone Wars: Season 7:</span> I remember feeling so disappointed when Disney bought Lucasfilm and immediately cancelled the 2008 Clone Wars show. It had been my stepping stone into the Star Wars universe (which I now follow very closely) and I loved the weekly adventures with Anakin, Ahsoka, Obi Wan, and all the other amazing characters they introduced and fleshed out. When they finally announced that the final season would be finished, I was beyond hyped. We would finally be able to see some of the unfinished episodes and ideas that I’d only heard about following the cancellation. And they delivered…mostly. I really loved the Bad Batch arc since I’m a huge clone trooper fan, but it was something we’d already seen from the unfinished episodes except for a few extra scenes. Ahsoka’s Walkabout arc was fine, not as great and was mostly setup for the final arc. The Siege of Mandalore though. That is arguably the best Star Wars content ever, up there with Revenge of the Sith, the Empire Strikes Back, and the Mandalorian Season 2 Finale. Finally seeing that story arc and how Order 66 went down for Ahsoka and Rex was such a satisfying conclusion to a show.</li>
                        <li><span class="Blog-itemHeading">Upgrading my Phone:</span> For Christmas, to take advantage of holiday deals, my mom and I went out to Costco to buy new phones for the both of us (our phones were around 4 years old at that point). After a lot of shopping around and trying to get an iPhone 12 PRO model for my mom, we finally bought our new phones and got a whole bunch of money back on the way. I now have a fancy new iPhone 12 Mini and bought myself a new Apple Watch SE to replace my old one. Upgrading tech is always fun.</li>
                        <li><span class="Blog-itemHeading">Beach Week 2020:</span> This was a pseudo-replacement for our graduation ceremony and our end-of-year Wushu club social that was cancelled due to COVID, one last hurrah before we (2020 grads) started working. Despite three out of the 10 people working internships at the time, we had a lot of fun going to the beach and spending time with each other. It was also the last time me and my girlfriend were together in person before we broke up. A bitter-sweet memory, but still a good time nonetheless.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Looking Forward to the Next Year</h2>
                    <p>The future is so foggy, but I can see some light shining through. The COVID vaccines are being distributed, so hopefully the pandemic can be over and we can go back to a somewhat normal life, whatever that means. I’ll at least be able to bond more with my coworkers and spend more time with friends without worrying about bringing COVID to my (slightly) more-at-risk parents. </p>
                    <p>The big thing I’m looking forward to next year is finally moving in with my former housemates from college. We originally planned to move around August, but with the multiple COVID surges on top of working at home, we didn’t think it was safe or necessary. Well, they didn’t think it was necessary; I wanted out of my home ASAP. The current plan is to move early 2021 (Jan – Mar), but that is still TBD since we’ve only compiled a list of places but haven’t contacted any directly yet. I’m looking forward to just having that proximity to my friends again and be able to play games or hang out with each other on a whim. </p>
                    <p>I also mentioned above that I might try streaming next year. I figured since I do a lot of shiny hunting that I could share it with the world and having like-minded people join in and hunt with me. I could capture my reactions when I get the shinies and, potentially, build a community around it. My current laptop likely can’t handle streaming (my graphics card is terrible), so it’s definitely something I’d start after I move out and buy/build a stronger PC.</p>
                    <p>Once vaccinations are out and we’re able to go out and do things again, I really want to go back to my old Wushu school and practice again. It’s going to take a while for me to build back up my strength and skills, but I would love to be able to jump around and swing around my weapons without worrying about breaking anything. It would also be great to be able to meet other people who share my interests and have that feeling of community again. I’ve been bad about keeping a consistent exercise routine during quarantine, but I know that if I have the motivation of practicing with other people and doing a sport I love, then I’ll give it everything I got, even if I’d be tired after work. </p>
                    <p>Next year also brings a lot of new exciting games and content. Like I mentioned above, Star Wars has a lot of new shows coming out next year and I’m excited for the Bad Batch show and the new Boba Fett show. Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is coming out around February so I’m super excited to play that. And the 25th anniversary of Pokémon is next year, so I’m excited to see what new games and events they’ll release with that. Will I ever finish my goal of getting every shiny legend from Dynamax Adventures? I hope so but with so much new stuff to play I’m not so sure. Regardless, I have high hopes for 2021 and I hope they aren’t dashed like they were for 2020. </p>
                    <p>Thank you to all my friends who have been there and supported me for the past year. I really couldn’t have made it through this year without the love and support you all have given me. I hope 2021 makes things right for everyone and we can all move past this pandemic. </p>
                    <p>Here’s to 2021.</p>

                    <p>I can’t believe it’s all over.</p>
                    <p>Four years of independence. Four years away from my home and parents. Four years of fun, frustration, friends, and new-found family. Four years of self-discovery, self-reliance, and growth. Four of the best years of my life.</p>
                    <p>Looking back on all the memories I’ve made over the past four years is hard, and not just because I have a terrible memory. It’s full of light and joy spent with my friends, going to trampoline parks, apple picking, watching movies, hiking, and so much more, but overshadowed by the emptiness that is the present. Of the heavy hand of coronavirus slapping down every plan we’ve made. No more final semester. No more friends. No more graduation. No more beach week. No more travel. Just staying home doing work without any of the fun that defined college. My vision is clouded by the disappointment of finishing college without the pomp and circumstance the previous years had. Our year, Class of 2020, will never know the joy of walking the Lawn after finishing our last finals or receiving our diplomas on stage or taking pictures on the Rotunda wearing our cap and gown. Our diplomas are getting mailed to us, like some $100,000 giant paper we bought off Amazon. And while we are getting a formal celebration in October or, god forbid, next May after Class of 2021, we’ll have moved on by then. It’s not going to be the same feeling. If anything, it’s more of a pity party than celebrating our achievements. </p>
                    <p>But I can’t let this crisis define my college career. It ruined the end, and I doubt I’ll ever forget it, but it’s not even a quarter of what my college experience was. The rest of it was composed of three big chunks: Wushu Club, TAing, and internships.</p>
                    <p>I can’t express how appreciative I am of Wushu Club at UVA for giving me the most supportive family I’ve ever experienced. Before coming to UVA I had been excited to get back into Wushu after a 6-year break, but I never thought that the club would be more than just a sports club. It’s also about the random trips to Cook Out and Kung Fu Tea, the road trips to UMD for competition and Joint Practice, the social events, the practice shenanigans, the random times we hung out at 2100 JPA, and so much more. The people in this club have taught me so much about not only Wushu, but also what it means to be a leader, coach, and brother. Of course I still have much to learn and made many mistakes along the way, but my Wushu family helped me start on this process.</p>
                    <p>I wouldn’t have gotten so attached to my Wushu family if it weren’t for my first breakup. In my second semester at UVA, my girlfriend since senior year of high school broke up with me for understandable reasons. She wanted to expand her horizons and have her own college experience instead of being tied down by a previous relationship. The reasoning was fine, but that didn’t alleviate how hard it hit me. While I was lucky to have come to college with a group of friends from high school, it soon hurt too much to be around them as they were all also friends with my ex. I retreated inward, as I tend do when things go wrong. I rarely left my dorm except for classes, food, and of course, Wushu practice. Practices were the only time in my week where I could take off the weights and let loose. It was the only time I could be my dumb and goofy self around people who could take it even further. It was the only light in the darkness I was living in. It was the only time I smiled or laughed that day. It was the only escape from the overwhelming loneliness I felt. It took me two weeks to tell them about my breakup as I couldn’t bring myself to bring that negativity into their lives. One of them innocently asked about my relationship over a meal and the whole group was shocked when I told them. After that moment, they were there for me. They invited me to hang out at their apartments to play games and watch movies or to eat with them after practices. Sharing my story with them helped me get over the breakup much faster and reinforced the idea that I had friends who loved and cared for me. I was no longer lonely; I had my Wushu brothers and sisters backing me up. I had a family who let me be me. And that gave me hope again.</p>
                    <p>My second year of college, I became a TA for CS 2110, the second course of our CS curriculum, taught in Java. Since I had previous experience in high school teaching a Java class, I figured that I would be a perfect fit for the job and get more official teaching experience (three years of helping teach at those accelerated summer camps barely counts). Little did I know that the next year, I would be one of the TA leads for the class and that, in two years, I would have taught the class longer than some of the professors. I was primarily in charge of the lab section, putting up the weekly labs and their associated files as well as tweaking or even replacing labs that were confusing or unnecessarily difficult. Halfway through my 3rd semester TAing, the professors had us start giving mini lectures to start and end each lab session. While I loved making the slideshows to accompany my lectures (yes I’m weird like that), I was never fond of public speaking. And for the students I had that semester, it was painfully obvious. I dived way too far into some topics while fumbling my way through others that I wasn’t as familiar with. Through weeks of practice, I grew more and more confident and began developing my own presentation style that I’ve used in other classes. Through my three years teaching that class, I can comfortably say that I’ve taught about a quarter of all CS majors in the classes from 2020 – 2023 and, hopefully, helped them appreciate CS more.</p>
                    <p>I was fortunate enough to get an internship after my first year (yes I’m a try-hard, but also thank you SGD) and it was a big eye-opening moment. It was the first time I lived on my own without the support of dining halls and Plus Dollars; I had to use my own money to buy food from a grocery store (omg what a tragedy). After that was two summers spent working for Yext in Tysons Corner and those were some of my fondest memories of my college career. Not only was I close with my fellow interns, I also bonded with the full-times and played Smash Bros with them during lunch breaks or on Fridays. Yext also organized intern social-events and let me do activities I never would have done on my own, like Escape Rooms, Georgetown cruises, painting, and bubble soccer. The fun didn’t stop there. Some interns organized impromptu social events at each other’s houses or apartments and we would play games and bond until 3 or 4 in the morning. I learned to let loose and not be so uptight about my schedule. Sure, I also got a lot of FOMO as I now wanted to experience everything for as long as I can, but time with friends often can’t be replaced and builds stronger relationships. This was the lesson my ex tried to teach me first year, but it only took a year and a half for me to understand. It helped me realize that college isn’t just about learning and working to get a degree and a job; it’s about building strong bonds with the people around you, as it is much harder once we graduate and start working.</p>
                    <p>The final defining moment in my college career was getting a Nintendo Switch after winning HooHacks my second year, thanks to Rashid Lasker, Jerry Lu, and William Li. I still have no idea how or why we won, but after we split the prize among the four of us I ended up with the Switch and a set of Philips Hue smart lightbulbs, but we’re focusing on the Switch. I hadn’t had a game console since the Wii in around 2007-2008, and even then I didn’t play games that much (classic “only play on weekends for an hour” parenting). Now that I was living on my own and had money from internships and teaching, I could buy my own games and play on my own time. Of course I had to get the major titles immediately: Mario Kart 8, Breath of the Wild, and Super Mario Odyssey. Over the next two years, I bought more and more games to expand my horizons to new genres and to experience franchises I’d only dream about when I was younger. Pokemon, Smash Bros Ultimate, and Mario & Rabbids soon joined the roster as well as many DLC packs. With my new console and games, I bonded more with my Wushu roommates and friends and gave us something to play when we all had free time or as a quick break.</p>
                    <p>There were plenty of other important moments and memories from the past four years that I can quickly list:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Getting Tiggs, my tiger plush: Even though I received him from my ex first year, I still cherish and love him as my child. He’s been with me through all my highs and lows and to this day I still cuddle with him when I sleep. I even have a bigger version of him I made third year during an event at the AFC where they let us stuff our own plush. Since tigers are my favorite animal, Tiggs is the perfect companion for me.</li>
                        <li>UVA Basketball winning the NCAA Championship: this was the only time I ever cared for college sports, but it was a great time to do so. I had watched the last seconds of the semifinals game at a Wushu competition that weekend and was instantly so invested in the “Heart Attack Hoos” that I had to watch the championship game a few days later. After we won, I went over to the Corner with my new girlfriend to watch the celebrations from atop a parking garage. And to top it all off, we shared our first kiss that night. One magical moment after another. Of course I had to buy a t-shirt and hoodie to commemorate that night.</li>
                        <li>Moving to 2100 Jefferson Park Ave: Originally, my plans third year were to stay at the same dorm I was in second year as it was a great central location and I didn’t have anyone to move in with. When one of my closest friends in the Wushu club said that one of his housemates wanted to move and that they had an open spot, I had to jump on it. While the dorm location was nice, I felt isolated from everyone and also had to move my belongings in and out every year. Moving to the apartment let me live with my two closest friends, be closer with everyone else, and leave my furniture there over the summer. It was the best opportunity I took and I was able to bond with my housemates and other club members when we hosted social events and game nights.</li>
                        <li>Spring Break Beach Week 2019: We spent the week at my girlfriend’s beach house in the Outer Banks with a bunch of other Wushu people and it was a week full of games, cooking together, and hot tub fun. Even though a lot of activities were closed, we still enjoyed the beach, sand dunes, and some delicious bagels. While I slipped into some dark places a few times and questioned my competence and self-worth (likely relapse from years before), it was nonetheless a great week and bonding experience for us.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Of course, college wasn’t all fun and games. I went through my first breakup, got food poisoning that prevented me from performing, was torn between my girlfriend and a new flame, suffered through many awful courses (curse you OS), and of course I had my final semester cut short by COVID-19. All of these experiences, while painful at the time, helped build me into the stronger person I am now.</p>
                    <p>But now it’s all done. These are all just memories now; memories that I will cherish for the rest of my life. I am so thankful for everyone that has been a part of my life until this point and I appreciate all the memories we’ve made together. You have all taught me so much and have supported me through all the highs and lows. I couldn’t ask for a better group of friends.</p>
                    <p>I will likely never have as much fun or be around as many friends as I was in college. I’ll be working a standard 9-5 job and endure a daily commute just like millions of other people, another car in the sea of NOVA traffic. I hope to find an apartment with my former housemates so I can move out of my parent’s house and also spend more time with my new family. I hope to continue practicing Wushu to keep myself active and to find a new group of people to grow and bond with. I hope to eventually have a special someone to love and care for and to start a family with. No matter what the future holds for me, I have the lessons I’ve learned in college to guide me. And most importantly, I have a family and hope.</p>
                    <p>“You don’t have friends, Kenny, you have family”. Thank you all for being the best family I could ask for.</p>

                    <p>In short, I’m angry. I’m not going to hide it anymore. It’s been eating me inside ever since this plague started cancelling everything. I see all these positivity posts on Facebook and YouTube push people to stay positive and optimistic in this crisis, and I understand why it’s necessary. However, nothing can fill the void that is now left in my soul. Nothing can give me back what I’m going to miss because of this. And I’m fucking pissed that I can’t do anything about it.</p>
                    <p>In the span of half a month, I’ve been taken from one of the highest points I’ve ever been in to probably the lowest point I’ve been in so far. Coming out of Winter Break and my family’s trip to California, I was excited for my final college semester, even though I signed up for the usual 17 credit workload instead of 12 or 13 typical of a final semester. The Game Design class, taught by one of my favorite professors at UVA, had come back after around 3 years and I was excited to be able to build games again just as I had with SGD less than a year ago. Our Wushu club would be starting to work on our ChinaFest performance with a theme that I’d wanted to do for so long: Kung Fu Panda. After ChinaFest, I was excited to teach our club members new forms to prepare for my final college Wushu competition: The Collegiate Wushu Competition hosted this year at Columbia University. I’d be able to have a final spring social with the club that now felt more like a family than simply a club sport. I’d spend a week at my girlfriend’s beach house with that family, bonding one last time with them before I officially leave the university. And finally, I’d be able to proudly walk the stage to receive what I’ve been working toward for the past 4 years: my diploma from the University of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>I never thought that Spring Break would be the end of my final college semester. When my family was forced to cancel our Spring Break trip to China to visit relatives, I thought nothing of the coronavirus. “It’s just like the flu, and it’s not like it’s in the US, nothing to worry about.” Oh how wrong I would be. When cases started popping up in this country, I still didn’t give a second glance. “Whatever, I’m young and healthy, I’ll be fine.” However, my parents had just returned from a trip to Iceland a few weeks before Spring Break (a few days before ChinaFest) and had gotten some mystery sickness there, so they persuaded me to stay in Charlottesville for the break. Disappointing, for sure, since all my friends were returning home, but I’ll live. If anything, spending time alone felt refreshing. I felt free of problems and could do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted.</p>
                    <p>And then it all came crashing down.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On the Wednesday March 11th, UVA officially moved its class online and requested that students not come back to Grounds after Spring Break. No more Wushu practice. No more friends. No more fun. </li>
                        <li>Two days later, Columbia’s Wushu Club officially cancelled the Collegiate Wushu Competition. The hope that I could at least finish my college Wushu career was gone.</li>
                        <li>The next week, classes would be held online for the rest of the semester. Further, and more painfully, graduation was cancelled.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Everything that I had hoped for was now gone. One last competition. One last Wushu social. One last Wushu photoshoot. One last beach week with my Wushu family. Graduating. Gone. </p>
                    <p>I was forced to go home the Wednesday after Spring Break. My parents had resorted to using a rumor of the threat of nationwide lockdown to force me to come home. And all I felt as I packed as much as I could into my car was defeat. For the past week and a half, I had held onto hope that things would get better, that I would be able to see my friends again and end my college years with a bang. That I could, at least, be able to spend my birthday (which was two days after I left) with my girlfriend, who had come back to Cville to ski for a weekend and wanted to stay for my birthday (Note that I hadn’t done anything special for my birthday in many years, so I had been excited that this would be the first. Oh how wrong I was). Except for the ski trip, which was pretty fun, all my plans went to hell. I spent another birthday, a day that almost everyone else at least tries to celebrate, as if it were just a regular day. If you count it, I can say that I celebrated my birthday by attending the first day of online classes.</p>
                    <p>I think the thing that hit me the hardest was graduation being cancelled. Graduation is, for 99% of college students, what four years of hard work, late nights, frustration, mediocre dining hall food, and post-practice Cook Out runs lead up to. It’s the final celebration of everything I’ve accomplished at the university and where a nobody like me can finally be recognized, if only for the two seconds it takes to say my name. It’s where my family and friends can cheer and take pictures of me in the classic graduation cap and gown. Everyone knows what graduation looks like, sounds like, and smells like; we’ve all been there when we graduated high school. But we’re now that 1% who can’t have one for college. From now on, we’ll look at our coworkers and future friends who will introduce themselves as so-and-so who graduated from whatever college and all we can say is “Must be nice”. To us, it must be nice to graduate from a university. It must be nice to have that ceremony to recognize your success and achievements. It must be nice to have graduation pictures. It must be nice to have a graduation photoshoot at the most iconic building on your campus. Must be nice, because we didn’t. An entire year of hard working students got denied this because of a stupid virus that won’t stop spreading. What was once a given for any person going to college has now been denied to us.</p>
                    <p>As positive and I try to be and as optimistic as I want to be, I can’t. There is literally nothing for me to look forward to. Everything that I had once wanted is now gone. I’m living day-by-day with no purpose other than to wake up tomorrow to do the same thing. And my motivation is gone too. What’s the point of doing well in classes anymore if I’m going to just get mailed a diploma I’ll never look at? It’s no longer an indicator of grit and hard work and accomplishment; it’s going to be a reminder of everything I’ve lost.</p>
                    <p>I hate to be this way. I want to stay positive and optimistic about the future, but I can’t think of anything other than the often repeated and useless saying of “It’ll get better eventually.” It’s not going to get better. I don’t care about being quarantined and spending months at home. All I want is to have the experiences that I would have had if none of this happened. Once this is all over, I’ll be left with nothing. Experiences are things I can never replace. My one chance to have all these “lasts” is going to come and go and I’ll be even more depressed and angry. Even if UVA decides to host a graduation ceremony after everything is cleaned up, it won’t be the same. Even if I come to a Wushu social next school year for one last social, it won’t be the same. Even if I eventually take graduation photos on the lawn and on the steps of the Rotunda, it won’t be the same. The time for all those things have passed. It’s not special anymore; if anything it’s a pity “sorry you missed everything that everyone else had” experience. And at that point, I don’t know if I even want it anymore. It’ll hurt too much. I’ll have already moved on, working at Amazon and more worried about the issues that come up in my job than getting an oversized piece of paper.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to write all this to get this off my chest. In the past I’ve written my feelings out and it’s felt better, but now I feel even more sad and angry than before. I don’t know if I’ll ever release this to other people but I guess it was good. Hopefully it’ll clear my mind so I can at least work for the next few months.</p>
