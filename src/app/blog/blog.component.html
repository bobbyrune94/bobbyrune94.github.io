                    <p>I can’t believe it’s all over.</p>
                    <p>Four years of independence. Four years away from my home and parents. Four years of fun, frustration, friends, and new-found family. Four years of self-discovery, self-reliance, and growth. Four of the best years of my life.</p>
                    <p>Looking back on all the memories I’ve made over the past four years is hard, and not just because I have a terrible memory. It’s full of light and joy spent with my friends, going to trampoline parks, apple picking, watching movies, hiking, and so much more, but overshadowed by the emptiness that is the present. Of the heavy hand of coronavirus slapping down every plan we’ve made. No more final semester. No more friends. No more graduation. No more beach week. No more travel. Just staying home doing work without any of the fun that defined college. My vision is clouded by the disappointment of finishing college without the pomp and circumstance the previous years had. Our year, Class of 2020, will never know the joy of walking the Lawn after finishing our last finals or receiving our diplomas on stage or taking pictures on the Rotunda wearing our cap and gown. Our diplomas are getting mailed to us, like some $100,000 giant paper we bought off Amazon. And while we are getting a formal celebration in October or, god forbid, next May after Class of 2021, we’ll have moved on by then. It’s not going to be the same feeling. If anything, it’s more of a pity party than celebrating our achievements. </p>
                    <p>But I can’t let this crisis define my college career. It ruined the end, and I doubt I’ll ever forget it, but it’s not even a quarter of what my college experience was. The rest of it was composed of three big chunks: Wushu Club, TAing, and internships.</p>
                    <p>I can’t express how appreciative I am of Wushu Club at UVA for giving me the most supportive family I’ve ever experienced. Before coming to UVA I had been excited to get back into Wushu after a 6-year break, but I never thought that the club would be more than just a sports club. It’s also about the random trips to Cook Out and Kung Fu Tea, the road trips to UMD for competition and Joint Practice, the social events, the practice shenanigans, the random times we hung out at 2100 JPA, and so much more. The people in this club have taught me so much about not only Wushu, but also what it means to be a leader, coach, and brother. Of course I still have much to learn and made many mistakes along the way, but my Wushu family helped me start on this process.</p>
                    <p>I wouldn’t have gotten so attached to my Wushu family if it weren’t for my first breakup. In my second semester at UVA, my girlfriend since senior year of high school broke up with me for understandable reasons. She wanted to expand her horizons and have her own college experience instead of being tied down by a previous relationship. The reasoning was fine, but that didn’t alleviate how hard it hit me. While I was lucky to have come to college with a group of friends from high school, it soon hurt too much to be around them as they were all also friends with my ex. I retreated inward, as I tend do when things go wrong. I rarely left my dorm except for classes, food, and of course, Wushu practice. Practices were the only time in my week where I could take off the weights and let loose. It was the only time I could be my dumb and goofy self around people who could take it even further. It was the only light in the darkness I was living in. It was the only time I smiled or laughed that day. It was the only escape from the overwhelming loneliness I felt. It took me two weeks to tell them about my breakup as I couldn’t bring myself to bring that negativity into their lives. One of them innocently asked about my relationship over a meal and the whole group was shocked when I told them. After that moment, they were there for me. They invited me to hang out at their apartments to play games and watch movies or to eat with them after practices. Sharing my story with them helped me get over the breakup much faster and reinforced the idea that I had friends who loved and cared for me. I was no longer lonely; I had my Wushu brothers and sisters backing me up. I had a family who let me be me. And that gave me hope again.</p>
                    <p>My second year of college, I became a TA for CS 2110, the second course of our CS curriculum, taught in Java. Since I had previous experience in high school teaching a Java class, I figured that I would be a perfect fit for the job and get more official teaching experience (three years of helping teach at those accelerated summer camps barely counts). Little did I know that the next year, I would be one of the TA leads for the class and that, in two years, I would have taught the class longer than some of the professors. I was primarily in charge of the lab section, putting up the weekly labs and their associated files as well as tweaking or even replacing labs that were confusing or unnecessarily difficult. Halfway through my 3rd semester TAing, the professors had us start giving mini lectures to start and end each lab session. While I loved making the slideshows to accompany my lectures (yes I’m weird like that), I was never fond of public speaking. And for the students I had that semester, it was painfully obvious. I dived way too far into some topics while fumbling my way through others that I wasn’t as familiar with. Through weeks of practice, I grew more and more confident and began developing my own presentation style that I’ve used in other classes. Through my three years teaching that class, I can comfortably say that I’ve taught about a quarter of all CS majors in the classes from 2020 – 2023 and, hopefully, helped them appreciate CS more.</p>
                    <p>I was fortunate enough to get an internship after my first year (yes I’m a try-hard, but also thank you SGD) and it was a big eye-opening moment. It was the first time I lived on my own without the support of dining halls and Plus Dollars; I had to use my own money to buy food from a grocery store (omg what a tragedy). After that was two summers spent working for Yext in Tysons Corner and those were some of my fondest memories of my college career. Not only was I close with my fellow interns, I also bonded with the full-times and played Smash Bros with them during lunch breaks or on Fridays. Yext also organized intern social-events and let me do activities I never would have done on my own, like Escape Rooms, Georgetown cruises, painting, and bubble soccer. The fun didn’t stop there. Some interns organized impromptu social events at each other’s houses or apartments and we would play games and bond until 3 or 4 in the morning. I learned to let loose and not be so uptight about my schedule. Sure, I also got a lot of FOMO as I now wanted to experience everything for as long as I can, but time with friends often can’t be replaced and builds stronger relationships. This was the lesson my ex tried to teach me first year, but it only took a year and a half for me to understand. It helped me realize that college isn’t just about learning and working to get a degree and a job; it’s about building strong bonds with the people around you, as it is much harder once we graduate and start working.</p>
                    <p>The final defining moment in my college career was getting a Nintendo Switch after winning HooHacks my second year, thanks to Rashid Lasker, Jerry Lu, and William Li. I still have no idea how or why we won, but after we split the prize among the four of us I ended up with the Switch and a set of Philips Hue smart lightbulbs, but we’re focusing on the Switch. I hadn’t had a game console since the Wii in around 2007-2008, and even then I didn’t play games that much (classic “only play on weekends for an hour” parenting). Now that I was living on my own and had money from internships and teaching, I could buy my own games and play on my own time. Of course I had to get the major titles immediately: Mario Kart 8, Breath of the Wild, and Super Mario Odyssey. Over the next two years, I bought more and more games to expand my horizons to new genres and to experience franchises I’d only dream about when I was younger. Pokemon, Smash Bros Ultimate, and Mario & Rabbids soon joined the roster as well as many DLC packs. With my new console and games, I bonded more with my Wushu roommates and friends and gave us something to play when we all had free time or as a quick break.</p>
                    <p>There were plenty of other important moments and memories from the past four years that I can quickly list:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Getting Tiggs, my tiger plush: Even though I received him from my ex first year, I still cherish and love him as my child. He’s been with me through all my highs and lows and to this day I still cuddle with him when I sleep. I even have a bigger version of him I made third year during an event at the AFC where they let us stuff our own plush. Since tigers are my favorite animal, Tiggs is the perfect companion for me.</li>
                        <li>UVA Basketball winning the NCAA Championship: this was the only time I ever cared for college sports, but it was a great time to do so. I had watched the last seconds of the semifinals game at a Wushu competition that weekend and was instantly so invested in the “Heart Attack Hoos” that I had to watch the championship game a few days later. After we won, I went over to the Corner with my new girlfriend to watch the celebrations from atop a parking garage. And to top it all off, we shared our first kiss that night. One magical moment after another. Of course I had to buy a t-shirt and hoodie to commemorate that night.</li>
                        <li>Moving to 2100 Jefferson Park Ave: Originally, my plans third year were to stay at the same dorm I was in second year as it was a great central location and I didn’t have anyone to move in with. When one of my closest friends in the Wushu club said that one of his housemates wanted to move and that they had an open spot, I had to jump on it. While the dorm location was nice, I felt isolated from everyone and also had to move my belongings in and out every year. Moving to the apartment let me live with my two closest friends, be closer with everyone else, and leave my furniture there over the summer. It was the best opportunity I took and I was able to bond with my housemates and other club members when we hosted social events and game nights.</li>
                        <li>Spring Break Beach Week 2019: We spent the week at my girlfriend’s beach house in the Outer Banks with a bunch of other Wushu people and it was a week full of games, cooking together, and hot tub fun. Even though a lot of activities were closed, we still enjoyed the beach, sand dunes, and some delicious bagels. While I slipped into some dark places a few times and questioned my competence and self-worth (likely relapse from years before), it was nonetheless a great week and bonding experience for us.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Of course, college wasn’t all fun and games. I went through my first breakup, got food poisoning that prevented me from performing, was torn between my girlfriend and a new flame, suffered through many awful courses (curse you OS), and of course I had my final semester cut short by COVID-19. All of these experiences, while painful at the time, helped build me into the stronger person I am now.</p>
                    <p>But now it’s all done. These are all just memories now; memories that I will cherish for the rest of my life. I am so thankful for everyone that has been a part of my life until this point and I appreciate all the memories we’ve made together. You have all taught me so much and have supported me through all the highs and lows. I couldn’t ask for a better group of friends.</p>
                    <p>I will likely never have as much fun or be around as many friends as I was in college. I’ll be working a standard 9-5 job and endure a daily commute just like millions of other people, another car in the sea of NOVA traffic. I hope to find an apartment with my former housemates so I can move out of my parent’s house and also spend more time with my new family. I hope to continue practicing Wushu to keep myself active and to find a new group of people to grow and bond with. I hope to eventually have a special someone to love and care for and to start a family with. No matter what the future holds for me, I have the lessons I’ve learned in college to guide me. And most importantly, I have a family and hope.</p>
                    <p>“You don’t have friends, Kenny, you have family”. Thank you all for being the best family I could ask for.</p>

                    <p>In short, I’m angry. I’m not going to hide it anymore. It’s been eating me inside ever since this plague started cancelling everything. I see all these positivity posts on Facebook and YouTube push people to stay positive and optimistic in this crisis, and I understand why it’s necessary. However, nothing can fill the void that is now left in my soul. Nothing can give me back what I’m going to miss because of this. And I’m fucking pissed that I can’t do anything about it.</p>
                    <p>In the span of half a month, I’ve been taken from one of the highest points I’ve ever been in to probably the lowest point I’ve been in so far. Coming out of Winter Break and my family’s trip to California, I was excited for my final college semester, even though I signed up for the usual 17 credit workload instead of 12 or 13 typical of a final semester. The Game Design class, taught by one of my favorite professors at UVA, had come back after around 3 years and I was excited to be able to build games again just as I had with SGD less than a year ago. Our Wushu club would be starting to work on our ChinaFest performance with a theme that I’d wanted to do for so long: Kung Fu Panda. After ChinaFest, I was excited to teach our club members new forms to prepare for my final college Wushu competition: The Collegiate Wushu Competition hosted this year at Columbia University. I’d be able to have a final spring social with the club that now felt more like a family than simply a club sport. I’d spend a week at my girlfriend’s beach house with that family, bonding one last time with them before I officially leave the university. And finally, I’d be able to proudly walk the stage to receive what I’ve been working toward for the past 4 years: my diploma from the University of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>I never thought that Spring Break would be the end of my final college semester. When my family was forced to cancel our Spring Break trip to China to visit relatives, I thought nothing of the coronavirus. “It’s just like the flu, and it’s not like it’s in the US, nothing to worry about.” Oh how wrong I would be. When cases started popping up in this country, I still didn’t give a second glance. “Whatever, I’m young and healthy, I’ll be fine.” However, my parents had just returned from a trip to Iceland a few weeks before Spring Break (a few days before ChinaFest) and had gotten some mystery sickness there, so they persuaded me to stay in Charlottesville for the break. Disappointing, for sure, since all my friends were returning home, but I’ll live. If anything, spending time alone felt refreshing. I felt free of problems and could do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted.</p>
                    <p>And then it all came crashing down.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On the Wednesday March 11th, UVA officially moved its class online and requested that students not come back to Grounds after Spring Break. No more Wushu practice. No more friends. No more fun. </li>
                        <li>Two days later, Columbia’s Wushu Club officially cancelled the Collegiate Wushu Competition. The hope that I could at least finish my college Wushu career was gone.</li>
                        <li>The next week, classes would be held online for the rest of the semester. Further, and more painfully, graduation was cancelled.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Everything that I had hoped for was now gone. One last competition. One last Wushu social. One last Wushu photoshoot. One last beach week with my Wushu family. Graduating. Gone. </p>
                    <p>I was forced to go home the Wednesday after Spring Break. My parents had resorted to using a rumor of the threat of nationwide lockdown to force me to come home. And all I felt as I packed as much as I could into my car was defeat. For the past week and a half, I had held onto hope that things would get better, that I would be able to see my friends again and end my college years with a bang. That I could, at least, be able to spend my birthday (which was two days after I left) with my girlfriend, who had come back to Cville to ski for a weekend and wanted to stay for my birthday (Note that I hadn’t done anything special for my birthday in many years, so I had been excited that this would be the first. Oh how wrong I was). Except for the ski trip, which was pretty fun, all my plans went to hell. I spent another birthday, a day that almost everyone else at least tries to celebrate, as if it were just a regular day. If you count it, I can say that I celebrated my birthday by attending the first day of online classes.</p>
                    <p>I think the thing that hit me the hardest was graduation being cancelled. Graduation is, for 99% of college students, what four years of hard work, late nights, frustration, mediocre dining hall food, and post-practice Cook Out runs lead up to. It’s the final celebration of everything I’ve accomplished at the university and where a nobody like me can finally be recognized, if only for the two seconds it takes to say my name. It’s where my family and friends can cheer and take pictures of me in the classic graduation cap and gown. Everyone knows what graduation looks like, sounds like, and smells like; we’ve all been there when we graduated high school. But we’re now that 1% who can’t have one for college. From now on, we’ll look at our coworkers and future friends who will introduce themselves as so-and-so who graduated from whatever college and all we can say is “Must be nice”. To us, it must be nice to graduate from a university. It must be nice to have that ceremony to recognize your success and achievements. It must be nice to have graduation pictures. It must be nice to have a graduation photoshoot at the most iconic building on your campus. Must be nice, because we didn’t. An entire year of hard working students got denied this because of a stupid virus that won’t stop spreading. What was once a given for any person going to college has now been denied to us.</p>
                    <p>As positive and I try to be and as optimistic as I want to be, I can’t. There is literally nothing for me to look forward to. Everything that I had once wanted is now gone. I’m living day-by-day with no purpose other than to wake up tomorrow to do the same thing. And my motivation is gone too. What’s the point of doing well in classes anymore if I’m going to just get mailed a diploma I’ll never look at? It’s no longer an indicator of grit and hard work and accomplishment; it’s going to be a reminder of everything I’ve lost.</p>
                    <p>I hate to be this way. I want to stay positive and optimistic about the future, but I can’t think of anything other than the often repeated and useless saying of “It’ll get better eventually.” It’s not going to get better. I don’t care about being quarantined and spending months at home. All I want is to have the experiences that I would have had if none of this happened. Once this is all over, I’ll be left with nothing. Experiences are things I can never replace. My one chance to have all these “lasts” is going to come and go and I’ll be even more depressed and angry. Even if UVA decides to host a graduation ceremony after everything is cleaned up, it won’t be the same. Even if I come to a Wushu social next school year for one last social, it won’t be the same. Even if I eventually take graduation photos on the lawn and on the steps of the Rotunda, it won’t be the same. The time for all those things have passed. It’s not special anymore; if anything it’s a pity “sorry you missed everything that everyone else had” experience. And at that point, I don’t know if I even want it anymore. It’ll hurt too much. I’ll have already moved on, working at Amazon and more worried about the issues that come up in my job than getting an oversized piece of paper.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to write all this to get this off my chest. In the past I’ve written my feelings out and it’s felt better, but now I feel even more sad and angry than before. I don’t know if I’ll ever release this to other people but I guess it was good. Hopefully it’ll clear my mind so I can at least work for the next few months.</p>
