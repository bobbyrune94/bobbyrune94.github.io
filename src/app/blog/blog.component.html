                    I like to write out my emotions during emotional times, so I'm posting them all here. It's helped me get my emotions together and work through them. Please excuse the writing as I'm not a professional nor practiced writer. Check out some of the topics I've written about.

                    <p>It’s been over said at this point: 2020 was an awful year. A global pandemic, a heated US presidential election, natural disasters, imminent WW3, and a whole host of other things made the past 365 days the most emotionally-taxing anxiety-inducing year I’ve had the (dis)pleasure of living in. I came into the year with so much hope. I was in my final year of college. I was offered a job at one of the biggest tech companies in the world. I had a group of friends who had loved and supported me throughout my college career and was looking forward to have a big celebration of everything we’d achieved at the end of the year. And then 2020 happened. Everything was cancelled, I was basically forced back into high school again living with my parents, and a lot of pain, anger, and frustration followed suit.</p>
                    <p>Despite the myriad of stressful events, I want to acknowledge that there was still some light. My time alone helped me learn more about myself. I tried out new games and made great achievements in the ones I was playing. I forced myself outside my comfort zone to seek out other people who share my hobbies online. I think now is a great time for me to reflect on what happened in the previous year to 1) help myself remember what happened because I know my memory is god awful and 2) see where I can grow in the next year. I wanted to do this for 2020 since it was a memorable year (in all the wrong ways), but I might continue it for future years if I feel it’s worth it. We’ll see.</p>
                    <p>And now, I present: 2020, the Good, the Bad, and the Future</p>
                    <h2>2020: The Worst Year of My Life (so far)</h2>
                    <h4>COVID-19 Pandemic</h4>
                    <p>We’ve been talking about this for the past 9 months (wow it’s been a long time) and I’ve made two other posts below about my feelings toward it, so I’ll try to keep it short here. It sucks. Everything I was looking forward to got cancelled, we were all forced back home to be effectively high schoolers again, it became difficult to see friends, and a LOT of people are dead/dying while idiots run around thinking it’s fake. </p>
                    <p>I think it’s safe to say that, while our leaders are doing their best to keep everyone safe and away from each other and large gatherings, this pandemic has taken a serious toll on our mental health. I wanted to have regular interactions with friends with game nights and impromptu game sessions, but over time those stopped happening as people started classes again and stopped inviting me to play games with them (I understand, I’m bad and not really fun to play with), so I started feeling lonely. Nobody wanted to hang out with me since I spend most of my time playing mostly single-player experiences as that’s how I’ve grown up and what I’m comfortable with. I desperately wanted to feel the sense of community I felt when I was still in Charlottesville and surrounded by friends to hang out with on a whim. </p>
                    <p>Like I said in the intro, so much got cancelled because of COVID. My vacation to China over Spring Break and Greece/Italy over the summer? Cancelled. Birthday celebration with friends? Cancelled. My final Wushu competition? Cancelled. College graduation? Cancelled. Trying to get an apartment with friends? Cancelled (more like delayed, but same idea). It really hurts to know that we’re missing out on once-in-a-lifetime events like having a graduation ceremony. Sure we can have one next year (or possibly in 2022 if things don’t settle down), but it won’t be the same as the feeling of pride right after you worked so hard to achieve it. I know it’s my FOMO talking, and some of my friends have told me that I’m not missing out on much, but this is something that I’d really like to experience and know than to sit here and only imagine what it would be like.</p>
                    <h4>A Breakup</h4>
                    <p>Partially because of COVID separation, partially because of incompatible futures, my girlfriend broke up with me. It came at a time when I was the most desperate for any kind of social interaction from anyone, especially her, but wasn’t getting since everyone was too busy. She’d been back at school and was trying to balance schoolwork, running a club, and so many other responsibilities that she didn’t have much time to keep our relationship going. Furthermore, since she’d accepted a job in Seattle, trying to keep connected across the country in the future would be even more difficult. It was the right decision, but I was still devastated. She’d been my best friend for the past almost 2.5 years and someone I felt like I shared my life with. She was someone I relied on for the support and love that I needed in this time of crisis and gave me the only social interaction outside of my parents and co-workers.</p>
                    <p>And just like that, she was no longer there. I spent a lot of time writing down my thoughts and feelings as they came to cope with this, which has since grown into a 20-page Word document (why can’t I write like this for school…). While the logical side of me knows that this was the right choice and that trying to continue would be harmful for both of us, I still felt hurt and betrayed. She left me when I needed her the most and showed me, once again, how insignificant and unworthy I am. If the person who says they loved and cared for me and that I’m “important” to them isn’t willing to put in effort with me anymore, then who will? The short, instinctive answer: Nobody. The long answer: I’ll be writing about that in the “Good parts of 2020” section.</p>
                    <p>Even though I have a lot of feelings about what happened, we’re still friends. We share some common interests and whenever something new in those interest happens (hint: it involves the Mandalorian), we’ll shoot each other a message and have a short talk about it. But of course it isn’t the same; it’ll never be the same. All I can do now is cherish the memories we made together. If you’re reading this, I just want to say: what the hell are you doing? Don’t you have better things to do? But seriously, thank you for an amazing 1.5 years and I hope you’ve had a relaxing holiday break. You deserve it. </p>
                    <h4>Loneliness</h4>
                    <p>This isn’t new. I’ve been a loner since middle school after my parents started taking my academics more seriously and I couldn’t play much with friends anymore. I’ve spent most of my life studying or watching YouTube videos alone at my desk in my room. This completely changed in college when I found a friend group (Wushu club) that would hang out and play games together on a whim and I didn’t need to ask my parents for permission. I loved the freedom that I had and also finally saw how fun it is to have such a group of friends who enjoy your company. It made me feel like I was worth something when people would go out of their way to invite me over to watch a movie or play some games or out to get food and just chat. </p>
                    <p>And, of course, I got sent back to high school with COVID. At the beginning, it was fine. We had weekly game nights with the Wushu club, I would talk to my girlfriend every night, and I would occasionally play other games like Fall Guys and Valorant with other friends. But once the new semester started, everything changed. People stopped coming to game nights since they were busy with schoolwork, so we couldn’t play larger party games like Among Us. My girlfriend decreased our weekly call times before breaking up with me altogether (see above section) since schoolwork started piling up. My other friends moved on from the games we played or didn’t want to play with me likely because I was bad (I don’t blame them). And COVID surges made it riskier to get together and hang out in person. While I feel like my friends were getting together over discord and playing together on a regular basis, I was left high and dry in my room by myself. </p>
                    <p>Starting a new job didn’t help much either since the only interactions I had with my co-workers were of me asking them questions on how to do something. The weekly social hours were nice and I could enjoy a game of Pictionary or poker with them, but I miss the casual break-room or cross-desk chats that I had at my previous internships. </p>
                    <h4>Christmas Oncall Shift</h4>
                    <p>This was just unfortunate luck on my end. My job requires that all engineers be oncall to resolve issues our service may encounter. When my manager added all the summer new hires into the rotation, I ended up being the primary oncall for the week of Christmas. Oh boy.</p>
                    <p>Oncall seems to be a gamble for how bad it’s going to be. Sometimes, it’s quiet and we don’t have to worry about much. Other times, some large-scale event will make our service cut a lot of tickets at odd hours of the night and we’d have to get up and fix them. Mine was leaning toward the latter, though I may be looking at it with the holidays in mind and the general “I don’t want to work during holiday” mindset. </p>
                    <p>I first had a great Christmas present at 7:00 in the morning which, if you know me, I was quite unhappy about getting up that early. Then, the day after Christmas, I spent 4 hours in the afternoon and paged in multiple senior engineers and product managers only to realize that snowfall the previous night was blocking one of our sensors. Not to mention the general anxiety of going about my day not knowing if I would get paged in the next minute and need to run to my computer. That was a fun time.</p>
                    <h2>2020: A Year of New Beginnings</h2>
                    <p>While I’m sure to remember this year for all the bad events, I want to balance it out by talking about the good that’s happened this year (at least for me). </p>
                    <h4>Reconnecting with Graduated Friends</h4>
                    <p>One of the positives of moving back with my parents was that I was closer to my old housemates who had graduated in 2019. We started hanging out in September, after a lot of my Wushu club friends had started school again and were bogged down in classes and projects. It was really nice to have a semi-regular social event with friends again.</p>
                    <p>Bonding with them along with my fellow 2020 graduates became super important after my girlfriend broke up with me. They became the people I immediately turned to for support and I spent a lot of time in the week following the breakup talking through my feelings and playing games with them. They reminded me that even though I lost my closest friend, I was never alone and I’d have them behind me to bring me back up when I needed it. Who will spend time with me if the person who “loved” and “cared” for me the most won’t? The (not really) long answer is these guys. </p>
                    <p>Something likely irrelevant but still important to me is that when I was at one of their apartments the day after my breakup, I found a shiny Kricketot in Pokemon Go. Most people don’t give a flying heck about this, but as a shiny hunter, it spoke to me. I don’t know the probability of finding that specific shiny in PoGo is, but I feel it’s really small, just like in all the other games. Finding that one specifically when I was in a time of need and talking to my friends makes me believe that it was put there to remind me that I’m not alone, no matter how lonely and sad I feel at the time. To commemorate that, I named it “YourNotAlone” (I ran out of characters, ok, don’t attack me) and I look at it every now and then to remind myself that I have friends who care about me. </p>
                    <h4>My First Job</h4>
                    <p>It still blows my mind that Amazon offered me a job as a Software Development Engineer all the way back in November of 2019. I finally started working there in July 2020 in the middle of the pandemic, so I haven’t been able to go into the office and get to know my coworkers. All of our interactions occur over Slack for texting or Amazon Chime for video calls or meetings. I already talked about how impersonal and removed I feel from my team, so I’m going to focus on the positives here.</p>
                    <p>I’m learning so much about AWS. I came into the job not knowing much about it, but through having to develop for our service, I’ve picked up so much knowledge both about how our system works and how to use other AWS services to help debug issues. Further, while I complained about my Christmas oncall shift, I’ve learned even more from being oncall as I’m forced to also deal with issues from other aspects of our service that I don’t normally touch. </p>
                    <p>I can’t wait go into the office next year and actually interact with my coworkers face-to-face once everyone gets the COVID vaccine and we can all more or less return back to normal. </p>
                    <h4>New Passion for Pokémon and Shiny Hunting</h4>
                    <p>This has been my biggest time sink of 2020. Before, I enjoyed the Pokémon franchise, but I hadn’t had the chance to dive in very deep. Once the first DLC of Pokémon Sword/Shield came out, I started watching PokeTubers (Pokémon Youtubers) more to see what other people playing this game do. And that’s when I decided to try shiny hunting. For those that don’t know, shiny Pokémon are ones that (normally) have a different color scheme from their base form and super low chance to appear. A lot of times, the shiny Pokémon look much cooler than the regular form. Before, I though shiny hunting was just a long and boring thing and doesn’t give enough reward. Once I started though, I realized how enjoyable it is and how easy it is to multitask. I would watch my daily selection of YouTube videos and shiny hunt at the same time and, when I got the shiny I wanted, I’d get that rush of adrenaline and excitement that keeps me going. As a wise Twitch streamer once said, “Shiny hunting is just reading chat with a 1/1365 chance to yell really loudly.”</p>
                    <p>When the second DLC for Sword/Shield came out, it introduced all the previous legendary Pokémon in a new game mode: Dynamax Adventures. And when I heard I could shiny hunt for them, I knew what I wanted to do: I would get every shiny legendary I could. I enjoy this method much more since I actually have to think about where I want to go and trying to build a team to tackle the final legendary boss instead of mindlessly biking back and forth to hatch eggs or encounter in the wild. I like the strategy behind this game mode and learning how to use each Pokémon as well as manipulating the NPCs that join you to have the best odds of defeating the boss. While I often rage at the incompetence and stupidity of the NPCs they give me (when I run solo raids), I enjoy the challenge and get really excited when I finally get the shiny legend that I’ve been hunting for. There’s also a chance to get a shiny of any Pokémon I catch along the way, so it’s also a pleasant surprise if one of those shines. As of now, I’ve found 21 of the 47 available legendaries, so I’m on track to finishing around April-May of next year, assuming I can get version exclusives don’t get royally messed up by Zygarde or Groudon. </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, my IRL friends don’t have the same passion for hunting as I do (I don’t blame them) so I’ve taken to watching Twitch streamers do the same thing. It’s been really great to find people who share my passion and also who will host raids that I can join and hunt with them. I’ve become more involved in a smaller streamer’s chat and it’s slowly bringing back the feeling of community I’ve been craving. TerribleTavi, if you’re somehow reading this, thank you so much for fostering such a welcoming community. I look forward to your streams every night and always have a great time watching and raiding with you. You’ve helped me grow my passion for these games and inspired me to both exercise again and to potentially start streaming next year. </p>
                    <p>As I mentioned above when talking about my friends, I also got back into playing Pokémon Go for a little bit. Quarantine has made me antsy just sitting at home so when the weather was nice, I would go on walks and play Pokémon Go to keep myself entertained. Recently, I’ve lost that passion since it’s been cold and I don’t like walking out in the cold, but I still follow any new events and try to catch any newly released Pokémon. </p>
                    <p>I think playing these games has shown me how much I enjoy collecting things. It could be that I like to 100% complete objectives, or it could be my FOMO talking, like knowing that I have everything so I’m not missing out. Either way, I know this passion for these games won’t be ending soon and I intend to keep following Pokémon for the foreseeable future.</p>
                    <h4>Other Games I Love</h4>
                    <p>I’m grouping these together since I don’t have as much to say about them, but they were still highlights for me regardless.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="Blog-itemHeading">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity:</span> I enjoyed the original Hyrule Warriors game and also loved the lore of Breath of the Wild, so I was super excited when this game was announced and pre-ordered it. This was probably the most fun I’ve had playing a game since playing through the Pokémon DLCs the first time. I love the fast-paced combat system and how unique each characters’ fighting styles were, though we all know Impa is the best. After months of just shiny hunting, it got my adrenaline pumping again with all the epic combos and finisher moves I could pull off. Also the way it incorporated BoTW and the Warrior’s mechanics was really clever. The story was pretty fun to play through, though it was not what Nintendo advertised it to be. Spent around 80 hours to 100% complete the game; was very worth it.</li>
                        <li><span class="Blog-itemHeading">Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes:</span> This is the mobile game that I’ve been playing for the past 3 or so years that focuses around collecting and upgrading iconic (and sometimes not-so-iconic) Star Wars characters. It’s a classic free-to-play, pay-to-win game, but I enjoy it simply because it’s Star Wars. The first half of the year was really bad with some meta-breaking characters, some of F2P unfriendly decisions and a whole lot of nothing for new content, but recently the game has been adding in a lot of quality-of-life updates and making the overall game more F2P and beginner friendly. Also, I recently finally unlocked a character I’d been working toward for the past year, so that was a major achievement from me.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Other Smaller, But Still Great Things</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="Blog-itemHeading">Wushu at Home with Brandon Sugiyama:</span> When I was forced home, I couldn’t practice Wushu anymore since there was no space to run and jump and swing around 7-foot spears. While I could practice outside, weather permitting, in the cul-de-sac, I didn’t have the motivation to as I missed the community I had as part of the UVA Wushu Club. In comes Brandon Sugiyama, a judge at one of our yearly competitions, hosting a twice-a-week Wushu class designed to be done in a confined area like an apartment or a room. Joining that class was so much fun as he taught us different styles and combinations and encouraged us to explore putting moves we practiced together and making our own sequences. I was sad to see it go as Brandon moved to a different country, but I look forward to it if he restarts it again.</li>
                        <li><span class="Blog-itemHeading">The Mandalorian: Season 2:</span> No spoilers, but that was an amazing season. Watching it gave me a lot of hope for the future of the Star Wars franchise (our lord and savior Dave Filoni). Not to mention the whole list of upcoming Star Wars shows that they announced at the investors meeting. I’m so excited for everything that’s coming.</li>
                        <li><span class="Blog-itemHeading">The Clone Wars: Season 7:</span> I remember feeling so disappointed when Disney bought Lucasfilm and immediately cancelled the 2008 Clone Wars show. It had been my stepping stone into the Star Wars universe (which I now follow very closely) and I loved the weekly adventures with Anakin, Ahsoka, Obi Wan, and all the other amazing characters they introduced and fleshed out. When they finally announced that the final season would be finished, I was beyond hyped. We would finally be able to see some of the unfinished episodes and ideas that I’d only heard about following the cancellation. And they delivered…mostly. I really loved the Bad Batch arc since I’m a huge clone trooper fan, but it was something we’d already seen from the unfinished episodes except for a few extra scenes. Ahsoka’s Walkabout arc was fine, not as great and was mostly setup for the final arc. The Siege of Mandalore though. That is arguably the best Star Wars content ever, up there with Revenge of the Sith, the Empire Strikes Back, and the Mandalorian Season 2 Finale. Finally seeing that story arc and how Order 66 went down for Ahsoka and Rex was such a satisfying conclusion to a show.</li>
                        <li><span class="Blog-itemHeading">Upgrading my Phone:</span> For Christmas, to take advantage of holiday deals, my mom and I went out to Costco to buy new phones for the both of us (our phones were around 4 years old at that point). After a lot of shopping around and trying to get an iPhone 12 PRO model for my mom, we finally bought our new phones and got a whole bunch of money back on the way. I now have a fancy new iPhone 12 Mini and bought myself a new Apple Watch SE to replace my old one. Upgrading tech is always fun.</li>
                        <li><span class="Blog-itemHeading">Beach Week 2020:</span> This was a pseudo-replacement for our graduation ceremony and our end-of-year Wushu club social that was cancelled due to COVID, one last hurrah before we (2020 grads) started working. Despite three out of the 10 people working internships at the time, we had a lot of fun going to the beach and spending time with each other. It was also the last time me and my girlfriend were together in person before we broke up. A bitter-sweet memory, but still a good time nonetheless.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Looking Forward to the Next Year</h2>
                    <p>The future is so foggy, but I can see some light shining through. The COVID vaccines are being distributed, so hopefully the pandemic can be over and we can go back to a somewhat normal life, whatever that means. I’ll at least be able to bond more with my coworkers and spend more time with friends without worrying about bringing COVID to my (slightly) more-at-risk parents. </p>
                    <p>The big thing I’m looking forward to next year is finally moving in with my former housemates from college. We originally planned to move around August, but with the multiple COVID surges on top of working at home, we didn’t think it was safe or necessary. Well, they didn’t think it was necessary; I wanted out of my home ASAP. The current plan is to move early 2021 (Jan – Mar), but that is still TBD since we’ve only compiled a list of places but haven’t contacted any directly yet. I’m looking forward to just having that proximity to my friends again and be able to play games or hang out with each other on a whim. </p>
                    <p>I also mentioned above that I might try streaming next year. I figured since I do a lot of shiny hunting that I could share it with the world and having like-minded people join in and hunt with me. I could capture my reactions when I get the shinies and, potentially, build a community around it. My current laptop likely can’t handle streaming (my graphics card is terrible), so it’s definitely something I’d start after I move out and buy/build a stronger PC.</p>
                    <p>Once vaccinations are out and we’re able to go out and do things again, I really want to go back to my old Wushu school and practice again. It’s going to take a while for me to build back up my strength and skills, but I would love to be able to jump around and swing around my weapons without worrying about breaking anything. It would also be great to be able to meet other people who share my interests and have that feeling of community again. I’ve been bad about keeping a consistent exercise routine during quarantine, but I know that if I have the motivation of practicing with other people and doing a sport I love, then I’ll give it everything I got, even if I’d be tired after work. </p>
                    <p>Next year also brings a lot of new exciting games and content. Like I mentioned above, Star Wars has a lot of new shows coming out next year and I’m excited for the Bad Batch show and the new Boba Fett show. Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is coming out around February so I’m super excited to play that. And the 25th anniversary of Pokémon is next year, so I’m excited to see what new games and events they’ll release with that. Will I ever finish my goal of getting every shiny legend from Dynamax Adventures? I hope so but with so much new stuff to play I’m not so sure. Regardless, I have high hopes for 2021 and I hope they aren’t dashed like they were for 2020. </p>
                    <p>Thank you to all my friends who have been there and supported me for the past year. I really couldn’t have made it through this year without the love and support you all have given me. I hope 2021 makes things right for everyone and we can all move past this pandemic. </p>
                    <p>Here’s to 2021.</p>

                    <p>I can’t believe it’s all over.</p>
                    <p>Four years of independence. Four years away from my home and parents. Four years of fun, frustration, friends, and new-found family. Four years of self-discovery, self-reliance, and growth. Four of the best years of my life.</p>
                    <p>Looking back on all the memories I’ve made over the past four years is hard, and not just because I have a terrible memory. It’s full of light and joy spent with my friends, going to trampoline parks, apple picking, watching movies, hiking, and so much more, but overshadowed by the emptiness that is the present. Of the heavy hand of coronavirus slapping down every plan we’ve made. No more final semester. No more friends. No more graduation. No more beach week. No more travel. Just staying home doing work without any of the fun that defined college. My vision is clouded by the disappointment of finishing college without the pomp and circumstance the previous years had. Our year, Class of 2020, will never know the joy of walking the Lawn after finishing our last finals or receiving our diplomas on stage or taking pictures on the Rotunda wearing our cap and gown. Our diplomas are getting mailed to us, like some $100,000 giant paper we bought off Amazon. And while we are getting a formal celebration in October or, god forbid, next May after Class of 2021, we’ll have moved on by then. It’s not going to be the same feeling. If anything, it’s more of a pity party than celebrating our achievements. </p>
                    <p>But I can’t let this crisis define my college career. It ruined the end, and I doubt I’ll ever forget it, but it’s not even a quarter of what my college experience was. The rest of it was composed of three big chunks: Wushu Club, TAing, and internships.</p>
                    <p>I can’t express how appreciative I am of Wushu Club at UVA for giving me the most supportive family I’ve ever experienced. Before coming to UVA I had been excited to get back into Wushu after a 6-year break, but I never thought that the club would be more than just a sports club. It’s also about the random trips to Cook Out and Kung Fu Tea, the road trips to UMD for competition and Joint Practice, the social events, the practice shenanigans, the random times we hung out at 2100 JPA, and so much more. The people in this club have taught me so much about not only Wushu, but also what it means to be a leader, coach, and brother. Of course I still have much to learn and made many mistakes along the way, but my Wushu family helped me start on this process.</p>
                    <p>I wouldn’t have gotten so attached to my Wushu family if it weren’t for my first breakup. In my second semester at UVA, my girlfriend since senior year of high school broke up with me for understandable reasons. She wanted to expand her horizons and have her own college experience instead of being tied down by a previous relationship. The reasoning was fine, but that didn’t alleviate how hard it hit me. While I was lucky to have come to college with a group of friends from high school, it soon hurt too much to be around them as they were all also friends with my ex. I retreated inward, as I tend do when things go wrong. I rarely left my dorm except for classes, food, and of course, Wushu practice. Practices were the only time in my week where I could take off the weights and let loose. It was the only time I could be my dumb and goofy self around people who could take it even further. It was the only light in the darkness I was living in. It was the only time I smiled or laughed that day. It was the only escape from the overwhelming loneliness I felt. It took me two weeks to tell them about my breakup as I couldn’t bring myself to bring that negativity into their lives. One of them innocently asked about my relationship over a meal and the whole group was shocked when I told them. After that moment, they were there for me. They invited me to hang out at their apartments to play games and watch movies or to eat with them after practices. Sharing my story with them helped me get over the breakup much faster and reinforced the idea that I had friends who loved and cared for me. I was no longer lonely; I had my Wushu brothers and sisters backing me up. I had a family who let me be me. And that gave me hope again.</p>
                    <p>My second year of college, I became a TA for CS 2110, the second course of our CS curriculum, taught in Java. Since I had previous experience in high school teaching a Java class, I figured that I would be a perfect fit for the job and get more official teaching experience (three years of helping teach at those accelerated summer camps barely counts). Little did I know that the next year, I would be one of the TA leads for the class and that, in two years, I would have taught the class longer than some of the professors. I was primarily in charge of the lab section, putting up the weekly labs and their associated files as well as tweaking or even replacing labs that were confusing or unnecessarily difficult. Halfway through my 3rd semester TAing, the professors had us start giving mini lectures to start and end each lab session. While I loved making the slideshows to accompany my lectures (yes I’m weird like that), I was never fond of public speaking. And for the students I had that semester, it was painfully obvious. I dived way too far into some topics while fumbling my way through others that I wasn’t as familiar with. Through weeks of practice, I grew more and more confident and began developing my own presentation style that I’ve used in other classes. Through my three years teaching that class, I can comfortably say that I’ve taught about a quarter of all CS majors in the classes from 2020 – 2023 and, hopefully, helped them appreciate CS more.</p>
                    <p>I was fortunate enough to get an internship after my first year (yes I’m a try-hard, but also thank you SGD) and it was a big eye-opening moment. It was the first time I lived on my own without the support of dining halls and Plus Dollars; I had to use my own money to buy food from a grocery store (omg what a tragedy). After that was two summers spent working for Yext in Tysons Corner and those were some of my fondest memories of my college career. Not only was I close with my fellow interns, I also bonded with the full-times and played Smash Bros with them during lunch breaks or on Fridays. Yext also organized intern social-events and let me do activities I never would have done on my own, like Escape Rooms, Georgetown cruises, painting, and bubble soccer. The fun didn’t stop there. Some interns organized impromptu social events at each other’s houses or apartments and we would play games and bond until 3 or 4 in the morning. I learned to let loose and not be so uptight about my schedule. Sure, I also got a lot of FOMO as I now wanted to experience everything for as long as I can, but time with friends often can’t be replaced and builds stronger relationships. This was the lesson my ex tried to teach me first year, but it only took a year and a half for me to understand. It helped me realize that college isn’t just about learning and working to get a degree and a job; it’s about building strong bonds with the people around you, as it is much harder once we graduate and start working.</p>
                    <p>The final defining moment in my college career was getting a Nintendo Switch after winning HooHacks my second year, thanks to Rashid Lasker, Jerry Lu, and William Li. I still have no idea how or why we won, but after we split the prize among the four of us I ended up with the Switch and a set of Philips Hue smart lightbulbs, but we’re focusing on the Switch. I hadn’t had a game console since the Wii in around 2007-2008, and even then I didn’t play games that much (classic “only play on weekends for an hour” parenting). Now that I was living on my own and had money from internships and teaching, I could buy my own games and play on my own time. Of course I had to get the major titles immediately: Mario Kart 8, Breath of the Wild, and Super Mario Odyssey. Over the next two years, I bought more and more games to expand my horizons to new genres and to experience franchises I’d only dream about when I was younger. Pokemon, Smash Bros Ultimate, and Mario & Rabbids soon joined the roster as well as many DLC packs. With my new console and games, I bonded more with my Wushu roommates and friends and gave us something to play when we all had free time or as a quick break.</p>
                    <p>There were plenty of other important moments and memories from the past four years that I can quickly list:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Getting Tiggs, my tiger plush: Even though I received him from my ex first year, I still cherish and love him as my child. He’s been with me through all my highs and lows and to this day I still cuddle with him when I sleep. I even have a bigger version of him I made third year during an event at the AFC where they let us stuff our own plush. Since tigers are my favorite animal, Tiggs is the perfect companion for me.</li>
                        <li>UVA Basketball winning the NCAA Championship: this was the only time I ever cared for college sports, but it was a great time to do so. I had watched the last seconds of the semifinals game at a Wushu competition that weekend and was instantly so invested in the “Heart Attack Hoos” that I had to watch the championship game a few days later. After we won, I went over to the Corner with my new girlfriend to watch the celebrations from atop a parking garage. And to top it all off, we shared our first kiss that night. One magical moment after another. Of course I had to buy a t-shirt and hoodie to commemorate that night.</li>
                        <li>Moving to 2100 Jefferson Park Ave: Originally, my plans third year were to stay at the same dorm I was in second year as it was a great central location and I didn’t have anyone to move in with. When one of my closest friends in the Wushu club said that one of his housemates wanted to move and that they had an open spot, I had to jump on it. While the dorm location was nice, I felt isolated from everyone and also had to move my belongings in and out every year. Moving to the apartment let me live with my two closest friends, be closer with everyone else, and leave my furniture there over the summer. It was the best opportunity I took and I was able to bond with my housemates and other club members when we hosted social events and game nights.</li>
                        <li>Spring Break Beach Week 2019: We spent the week at my girlfriend’s beach house in the Outer Banks with a bunch of other Wushu people and it was a week full of games, cooking together, and hot tub fun. Even though a lot of activities were closed, we still enjoyed the beach, sand dunes, and some delicious bagels. While I slipped into some dark places a few times and questioned my competence and self-worth (likely relapse from years before), it was nonetheless a great week and bonding experience for us.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Of course, college wasn’t all fun and games. I went through my first breakup, got food poisoning that prevented me from performing, was torn between my girlfriend and a new flame, suffered through many awful courses (curse you OS), and of course I had my final semester cut short by COVID-19. All of these experiences, while painful at the time, helped build me into the stronger person I am now.</p>
                    <p>But now it’s all done. These are all just memories now; memories that I will cherish for the rest of my life. I am so thankful for everyone that has been a part of my life until this point and I appreciate all the memories we’ve made together. You have all taught me so much and have supported me through all the highs and lows. I couldn’t ask for a better group of friends.</p>
                    <p>I will likely never have as much fun or be around as many friends as I was in college. I’ll be working a standard 9-5 job and endure a daily commute just like millions of other people, another car in the sea of NOVA traffic. I hope to find an apartment with my former housemates so I can move out of my parent’s house and also spend more time with my new family. I hope to continue practicing Wushu to keep myself active and to find a new group of people to grow and bond with. I hope to eventually have a special someone to love and care for and to start a family with. No matter what the future holds for me, I have the lessons I’ve learned in college to guide me. And most importantly, I have a family and hope.</p>
                    <p>“You don’t have friends, Kenny, you have family”. Thank you all for being the best family I could ask for.</p>

                    <p>In short, I’m angry. I’m not going to hide it anymore. It’s been eating me inside ever since this plague started cancelling everything. I see all these positivity posts on Facebook and YouTube push people to stay positive and optimistic in this crisis, and I understand why it’s necessary. However, nothing can fill the void that is now left in my soul. Nothing can give me back what I’m going to miss because of this. And I’m fucking pissed that I can’t do anything about it.</p>
                    <p>In the span of half a month, I’ve been taken from one of the highest points I’ve ever been in to probably the lowest point I’ve been in so far. Coming out of Winter Break and my family’s trip to California, I was excited for my final college semester, even though I signed up for the usual 17 credit workload instead of 12 or 13 typical of a final semester. The Game Design class, taught by one of my favorite professors at UVA, had come back after around 3 years and I was excited to be able to build games again just as I had with SGD less than a year ago. Our Wushu club would be starting to work on our ChinaFest performance with a theme that I’d wanted to do for so long: Kung Fu Panda. After ChinaFest, I was excited to teach our club members new forms to prepare for my final college Wushu competition: The Collegiate Wushu Competition hosted this year at Columbia University. I’d be able to have a final spring social with the club that now felt more like a family than simply a club sport. I’d spend a week at my girlfriend’s beach house with that family, bonding one last time with them before I officially leave the university. And finally, I’d be able to proudly walk the stage to receive what I’ve been working toward for the past 4 years: my diploma from the University of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>I never thought that Spring Break would be the end of my final college semester. When my family was forced to cancel our Spring Break trip to China to visit relatives, I thought nothing of the coronavirus. “It’s just like the flu, and it’s not like it’s in the US, nothing to worry about.” Oh how wrong I would be. When cases started popping up in this country, I still didn’t give a second glance. “Whatever, I’m young and healthy, I’ll be fine.” However, my parents had just returned from a trip to Iceland a few weeks before Spring Break (a few days before ChinaFest) and had gotten some mystery sickness there, so they persuaded me to stay in Charlottesville for the break. Disappointing, for sure, since all my friends were returning home, but I’ll live. If anything, spending time alone felt refreshing. I felt free of problems and could do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted.</p>
                    <p>And then it all came crashing down.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On the Wednesday March 11th, UVA officially moved its class online and requested that students not come back to Grounds after Spring Break. No more Wushu practice. No more friends. No more fun. </li>
                        <li>Two days later, Columbia’s Wushu Club officially cancelled the Collegiate Wushu Competition. The hope that I could at least finish my college Wushu career was gone.</li>
                        <li>The next week, classes would be held online for the rest of the semester. Further, and more painfully, graduation was cancelled.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Everything that I had hoped for was now gone. One last competition. One last Wushu social. One last Wushu photoshoot. One last beach week with my Wushu family. Graduating. Gone. </p>
                    <p>I was forced to go home the Wednesday after Spring Break. My parents had resorted to using a rumor of the threat of nationwide lockdown to force me to come home. And all I felt as I packed as much as I could into my car was defeat. For the past week and a half, I had held onto hope that things would get better, that I would be able to see my friends again and end my college years with a bang. That I could, at least, be able to spend my birthday (which was two days after I left) with my girlfriend, who had come back to Cville to ski for a weekend and wanted to stay for my birthday (Note that I hadn’t done anything special for my birthday in many years, so I had been excited that this would be the first. Oh how wrong I was). Except for the ski trip, which was pretty fun, all my plans went to hell. I spent another birthday, a day that almost everyone else at least tries to celebrate, as if it were just a regular day. If you count it, I can say that I celebrated my birthday by attending the first day of online classes.</p>
                    <p>I think the thing that hit me the hardest was graduation being cancelled. Graduation is, for 99% of college students, what four years of hard work, late nights, frustration, mediocre dining hall food, and post-practice Cook Out runs lead up to. It’s the final celebration of everything I’ve accomplished at the university and where a nobody like me can finally be recognized, if only for the two seconds it takes to say my name. It’s where my family and friends can cheer and take pictures of me in the classic graduation cap and gown. Everyone knows what graduation looks like, sounds like, and smells like; we’ve all been there when we graduated high school. But we’re now that 1% who can’t have one for college. From now on, we’ll look at our coworkers and future friends who will introduce themselves as so-and-so who graduated from whatever college and all we can say is “Must be nice”. To us, it must be nice to graduate from a university. It must be nice to have that ceremony to recognize your success and achievements. It must be nice to have graduation pictures. It must be nice to have a graduation photoshoot at the most iconic building on your campus. Must be nice, because we didn’t. An entire year of hard working students got denied this because of a stupid virus that won’t stop spreading. What was once a given for any person going to college has now been denied to us.</p>
                    <p>As positive and I try to be and as optimistic as I want to be, I can’t. There is literally nothing for me to look forward to. Everything that I had once wanted is now gone. I’m living day-by-day with no purpose other than to wake up tomorrow to do the same thing. And my motivation is gone too. What’s the point of doing well in classes anymore if I’m going to just get mailed a diploma I’ll never look at? It’s no longer an indicator of grit and hard work and accomplishment; it’s going to be a reminder of everything I’ve lost.</p>
                    <p>I hate to be this way. I want to stay positive and optimistic about the future, but I can’t think of anything other than the often repeated and useless saying of “It’ll get better eventually.” It’s not going to get better. I don’t care about being quarantined and spending months at home. All I want is to have the experiences that I would have had if none of this happened. Once this is all over, I’ll be left with nothing. Experiences are things I can never replace. My one chance to have all these “lasts” is going to come and go and I’ll be even more depressed and angry. Even if UVA decides to host a graduation ceremony after everything is cleaned up, it won’t be the same. Even if I come to a Wushu social next school year for one last social, it won’t be the same. Even if I eventually take graduation photos on the lawn and on the steps of the Rotunda, it won’t be the same. The time for all those things have passed. It’s not special anymore; if anything it’s a pity “sorry you missed everything that everyone else had” experience. And at that point, I don’t know if I even want it anymore. It’ll hurt too much. I’ll have already moved on, working at Amazon and more worried about the issues that come up in my job than getting an oversized piece of paper.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to write all this to get this off my chest. In the past I’ve written my feelings out and it’s felt better, but now I feel even more sad and angry than before. I don’t know if I’ll ever release this to other people but I guess it was good. Hopefully it’ll clear my mind so I can at least work for the next few months.</p>
