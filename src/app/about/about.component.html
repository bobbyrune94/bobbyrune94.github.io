        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <div class="About-section">
            <h4><img class="About-icon" src="assets/images/aboutIcons/student.svg"/> I'm a Learner</h4>
            <p>I graduated from the University of Virginia majoring in Computer Science and Psychology. With that combination, I’ll be programming the robots that take over the world, at least according to my sister. Regardless of what I do in the future, I’ll always be learning. In college, it was when I sat in class listening to a professor lecture about how the cloud works or how our brains process information. At my current job, it’s learning coding and software development skills from my managers and mentors and working with them to solve problems. While streaming, it’s learning both how to play new games, engage with the audience, and add new features and components to make my streams look and feel cleaner. </p>        </div>
        <div class="About-section">
            <h4><img class="About-icon" src="assets/images/aboutIcons/teacher.svg"/> I'm a Teacher</h4>
            <p>While most of my time as a student was focused on learning and studying, I also spent time every week as a teaching assistant and coach. </p>
            <p>In college, I helped teach CS 2110, which is the second computer science course students take at UVA and focuses on Java, Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, and some software development methods. Since my favorite programming language is Java, teaching this course felt natural for me to do. I also took the role of Head Lab Teaching Assistant my second year teaching, where I gave a quick lecture at the beginning of every lab section explaining the concepts students will use for the lab and also a wrap-up at the end of lab, going over solutions and making sure students understood how to solve the lab if they hadn’t already. I really enjoyed this job because I explained concepts to students in a different way to help them understand better and also cleared up any confusions they may have from regular lectures. Also, through giving these lectures, I became much more comfortable presenting and talking in front of large groups of people and thinking quickly when students ask questions.</p>
            <p>I also coached UVA’s Wushu Club starting my second-year of college. If you don’t know what Wushu is, it’s a performance-based Chinese martial art that emphasizes flying jumps and large sweeping motions (<a routerLink="/performances/wushu">click here</a> to see my performances and competitions). I had started Wushu when I was in around third grade, but took a break after middle school due to knee issues. I wanted to continue training in college, so I joined the club. As one of the most experienced members in the club, it became my job to help lead practices, teach forms and weapons, and to choreograph performances. Often times, I hadn’t learned a form that someone wants to learn, so I had to quickly look at a video and learn a wide variety of weapons and styles to be able to teach them to my friends. While it was tiring and I wasn’t able to practice on my own as much, it was really fun to learn so many styles and transferring that knowledge.</p>

            <h4><img class="About-icon" src="assets/images/aboutIcons/programmer.svg"/> I'm an Engineer and Programmer</h4>
            <p>My story of how I got into programming and computer science is a classic one. I enjoyed math in elementary and middle school and figured to try programming in high school and enjoyed it ever since. I’ve always seen programming as the logical next step for math. Like math, it takes previously learned ideas and concepts (algorithms, data structures, etc.) and applies them to new problems. Unlike math, programming can often show whether a solution is correct or not and often seeing an issue can indicate where the problem is hiding. </p>
            <p>Throughout college, I’ve been able to learn about many different fields of computer science, including game and web development, databases, and machine learning. I’ve also been fortunate enough to have had an internship every summer after my first year where I applied what I’ve learned to do real work for the companies that I worked for. Learning so much these past few years has made me excited to see where my career will go and what new skills I’ll pick up from my future mentors and coworkers.

            <h4><img class="About-icon" src="assets/images/aboutIcons/martialarts.svg"/> I'm a Performing Artist and Athlete</h4>
            <p>As I mentioned above, I’ve been doing Wushu since third grade and I’ve always enjoyed performing in front of others. It’s exciting to wow a crowd with flashy weapons and high-flying jumps. When I choreographed performances for my club, I tried to ensure that our performances are as high-energy and exciting as possible. Check out some of our pictures and performances <a routerLink="/performances/wushu">here</a>.</p>
            <p>During my break from Wushu in middle and high school, I played tennis for a few years until I didn’t make the cut for my high school’s tennis team. However, another athletic opportunity presented itself. At the (rather forceful) pushing of two friends, I joined my high school’s cheerleading team. This was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. It was the first time I became part of a tight-knit family that depended on and trusted one another. It was the first time I became a leader. It was the first time I was pushed far outside my comfort zone and forced to confront my fears. Through cheer I made so many close friends and learned both how to work on a team and how to be an effective leader and mentor. I overcame my fear of flipping to learn how to tumble. While I have few regrets from my time in high school, my biggest regret was not joining cheer sooner. Check out some of our performances here.</p>

            <div class="About-withPictures">
                <p>My family loves travelling and hiking. When I was younger, we’d travel around the US to national parks and hike on their trails to see their breathtaking views and outlooks. After I moved off to college, they took me to many more places whenever I had a break. Their excuse is because I won’t be able to travel once I start working, but we all know it’s for my dad to take more pictures. We went to Europe for the first time in the summer of 2018 before my internship that year. And since my dad loves taking pictures, we always come back from every trip with hundreds of pictures.

            <h4><img class="About-icon" src="assets/images/aboutIcons/starwars.svg"/> I'm a Nerd</h4>
            <p>I’m a huge Star Wars fan. I’ve been one ever since my dad gave me my first Lego Star Wars set when I was around 6 years old: the Lego X-Wing Fighter with Yoda’s Hut. Since then my collection has grown…a lot. I played the Lego Star Wars games on the Wii where I learned what happened in the first 6 movies and the Clone Wars TV show. I watched all the movies, both Clone Wars TV shows, and every TV series since. I watch a number of YouTubers who cover every new Star Wars comic, book, or game that comes out and explain the new additions to the lore as well as what happened in the old expanded universe (now called Legends). I play a mobile game called Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes where I can collect, upgrade, and battle with characters from variety of media from the movies to old games to the TV series. I even got a Disney+ subscription just to watch Star Wars on demand. Star Wars has become a part of my identity. Anyone who has seen my room or my desk can easily tell how big of a fan I am.</p>
            <p>Before you ask, here are my answers to the important questions for every Star Wars fan</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Favorite Character?</b> Can’t really pick one, but I’d say my favorites would be Captain Rex, Ahsoka, and Anakin. I was first introduced through the 2008 Clone Wars show, so I’m very biased there.</li>
                <li><b>Favorite Ship?</b> X-wing. I have a special connection with it since it was my first Star Wars Lego set</li>
                <li><b>Color of Lightsaber?</b> I want a red lightsaber because red is my favorite color but since colors actually have meaning, I’d realistically end up with either a blue or yellow one.</li>
                <li><b>Jedi or Sith?</b> Grey Jedi. I want to be mostly light but also be able to use dark side abilities because they’re cool. I don’t like being on such extremes like the Jedi and Sith.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><img class="About-icon" src="assets/images/aboutIcons/switch.svg"/> I'm a Gamer</h4>
            <p>Since I was little, I’ve always been restless. I’d rather be playing with my Legos and coming up with adventures for my characters to embark on than sit on the couch and read a book. I’d rather be practicing sports like Wushu or tennis than practicing violin. I’d rather be thinking and interacting with a game than mindlessly watching a TV show. </p>
            <p>I’ve been playing games since I got a Nintendo GameCube many years ago to play Super Smash Bros Melee with my neighbor. I’ve been loyal to Nintendo since, getting a Wii where I played the new Smash Bros Brawl game, Mario Kart Wii, and the Lego Star Wars games. I also would play the Tanks game on Wii Play with my sister when she’d come back from medical school. I also played MMORPGs like Runescape and a little bit of Maplestory with my friends in around 4th to 6th grades. My best friend in elementary and middle school also introduced me to the Halo franchise, which I’ve been interested in ever since. However, I didn’t play these games all that often once I went to middle and high school since I had more homework to do and also discovered the Internet and YouTube and all the cool Star Wars videos I could watch there.</p>
            <p>Everything changed when I went to college and won a Nintendo Switch from HooHacks 2018. I’ve since bought many more games than I had when I was younger: Breath of the Wild, Mario Odyssey, Smash Bros Ultimate, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Pokemon Sword and Let’s Go Eevee, and more. Even better is that my friends also have switches with similar games, so we can often play together on multiplayer games or connect through local wireless connections. I’ve also brought my Switch with me when travelling to entertain me on long flights or at night before bed.</p>

            <h4><img class="About-icon" src="assets/images/aboutIcons/stream.svg"/> I'm a Streamer</h4>
            <p>I discovered Twitch during the COVID quarantine in 2020 graduating college and realizing YouTube couldn’t provide enough content to entertain me in my newfound free time. Originally, I followed people I watched on YouTube, but slowly discovered more Poke streamers through raids. For those unfamiliar, Twitch raids are when a streamer who’s finishing their own stream sends their viewers to another stream to show support and share communities.</p>
            <p>One fateful raid from Reversal (<a href="http://twitch.tv/reversal">twitch.tv/reversal</a>) lead me to the small-at-the-time streamer TerribleTavi (<a href="http://twitch.tv/terribletavi">twitch.tv/terribletavi</a>). I immediately loved the energy, interactivity, and physique that Tavi brought to his streams. He read and responded to everyone in chat in a way that fostered more discussion and, on top of that, promoted a healthy and active lifestyle, something I needed after being a desk potato for the past half year. Further, he was shiny hunting in the Dynamax Adventures in Pokemon Sword/Shield, which I was also doing at the time, and invited people in his chat to join him and the community. I was hooked. After a couple months of watching his community grow and moderating for him, I was inspired to stream myself. </p>
            <p>My goals for streaming are two-fold. My first goal was to create a community of my own that promoted inclusivity and positivity for everyone. The bigger of my two goals was to have a platform to spread and share my love for gaming, Nintendo, and most importantly, martial arts. I wanted to continue my work from UVA Wushu and share my art with as many people as I can. As I play games, I allow my viewers to have me do quick Wushu or lightsaber combinations or pull up old videos and react to them. I also stream my own practices to show Wushu outside of my room’s constraints and to teach viewers skills like weapon spinning or even quick combos they can do themselves.</p>
            <p>Streaming Milestones:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Started Streaming: August 22, 2021</li>
                <li>Twitch Affiliate: September 7th, 2021</li>
                <li>100 Followers: October 8th, 2021</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Currently, I’m streaming primarily Pokémon and Nintendo content with the occasional Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes when there’s something interesting to show. I also love to open Pokémon cards on stream as I am an avid card collector. In the future, I plan to play any new major Pokémon, Legend of Zelda, and Star Wars game. If you’re interested in those games or just want to hang out, check me out at <a href="http://twitch.tv/kungfu_kenny98">twitch.tv/kungfu_kenny98</a>. I’d love to see you there! </p>
